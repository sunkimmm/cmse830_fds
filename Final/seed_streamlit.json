This includes all and black carbon . measures in accordance with the mitigation hierarchy. The measures will be proportionate to the risks and impacts associated with the project and consistent with , in the first instance the . resource efficiency The Borrower will implement technically and financially feasible measures for improving efficient consumption of energy, water and raw materials, as well as other resources. Such measures will integrate the principles of cleaner production into product design and production processes to conserve raw materials, energy and water, as well as other resources. Where benchmarking data are available, the Borrower will make a comparison to establish the relative level of efficiency. a. Energy use The efficient use of energy is an important way in which the Borrower can contribute to sustainable development. When the project is a potentially significant user of energy, in addition to applying the resource efficiency requirements of this , the Borrower will adopt measures specified in the to optimize energy usage, to the extent technically and financially feasible. B. water use When the project is a potentially significant user of water or will have potentially significant impacts on water quality, in addition to applying the resource efficiency requirements of this , the Borrower will adopt measures, to the extent technically and financially feasible, that avoid or minimize water usage so that the project\u2019s water use does not have significant adverse impacts on communities, other users and the environment. These measures include, but are not limited to, the use of additional technically feasible water conservation measures within the Borrower\u2019s operations, the use of alternative water supplies, water consumption offsets to maintain total demand for water resources within the available supply, and evaluation of alternative project locations. For projects with a high water demand that have potentially significant adverse impacts on communities, other users or the environment, the following will apply: a detailed water balance will be developed, maintained, monitored and reported periodically; Opportunities for improvement in water use efficiency will be identified and implemented; Specific water use will be assessed; and Operations must be bench marked to available industry standards of water use efficiency. The Borrower will assess, as part of the environmental and social assessment, the potential impacts of water use upon communities, users and the environment and will identify implement appropriate mitigation measures. raw material use When the project is a potentially significant user raw materials, in addition to applying the resource requirements of this , the Borrower adopt measures specified in the and to support efficient use of raw materials, the extent technically and financially feasible. prevention and management The Borrower will avoid the release of pollutants when avoidance is not feasible, minimize and the concentration and mass flow of their using the performance levels and measures in national law or the , whichever is stringent. This applies to the release of polto air, water and land due to routine, nonand accidental circumstances, and with potential for local, regional, and transboundary Where the project involves historical pollution, Borrower will establish a process to identify the party. If the historical pollution could a significant risk to human health or the envithe Borrower will undertake a health safety risk assessment of the existing polwhich may affect communities, workers and environment. Any remediation of the site will appropriately undertaken in accordance with law and , whichever is most stringent. These measures can include reuse or recycling of materials. Borrower will seek to reduce or eliminate the use of toxic or raw materials. In this context historical pollution is defined as pollution from activities affecting land and water resources for which no has assumed or been assigned responsibility to address carry out the required remediation. Such assessment will follow a risk-based approach consistent , in the first instance the . If one or more third parties are responsible for the historical the Borrower will consider seeking recourse from such so that such pollution is appropriately remediated. The will implement adequate measures so that historical at the site does not pose a significant risk to the health safety of workers and communities. To address potential adverse project impacts on human health and the environment, the Borrower will consider relevant factors, including, for example: existing ambient conditions; in areas already impacted by pollution, the remaining assimilative capacity of the enironment cexisting and future land use; the project\u2019s proximity to areas of importance to biodiversity; the potential for cumulative impacts with uncertain and or irreversible consequences; and impacts of climate change. In addition to applying resource efficiency and pollution control measures as required in this , when the project has the potential to constitute a significant source of emissions in an already degraded area, the Borrower will consider additional strategies and adopt measures that avoid or minimize negative effects. These strategies include, but are not limited to, evaluation of project location alternatives. a. management of air pollution In addition to the resource efficiency measures described above, the Borrower will consider alternatives and implement technically and financially feasible and cost-effective options to avoid or minimize project-related air emissions during the design, construction and operation of the project. As part of the of the project, the Borrower will characterize and estimate sources of air pollution related to the Such as air, surface and groundwater and soils. Assimilative capacity refers to the capacity of the environment for absorbing an incremental load of pollutants while remaining below a threshold of unacceptable risk to human health and the environment. 1\u2018 Air pollution\u2019 refers to the release of air pollutants , such as nitrogen oxides late matter , , sulfur as dioxide well as , other carbon contaminants monoxide including , particuGHGs. Cost-effectiveness is determined according to the capital and operational cost and financial benefits of the options considered over the life of the project. The options for reducing or preventing air pollution may include a combination of approaches such as: enhancing energy efficiency, process modification, selection of fuels or other materials with less polluting emissions, and application of emissions control techniques. Options for reducing emissions may include alternative project locations; adoption of renewable or low carbon energy sources; alternatives to refrigerants with high global warming potential; more sustainable agricultural, forestry and livestock management practices; the reduction of fugitive emissions and gas flaring; carbon sequestration and storage; sustainable transport alternatives; and proper waste management practices. This will include an estimate of gross resulting from the project, providing that estimation is technically and financially feasible where the Borrower does not have the capacto develop the estimate of emissions, the will provide assistance to the Borrower. For that have diverse and small sources of or where emissions are not likely be significant , estimations will not be management of hazardous and nonhazardous wastes The Borrower will avoid the generation of hazand nonhazardous waste. Where waste cannot be avoided, the Borrower will the generation of waste, and reuse, recyand recover waste in a manner that is safe for health and the environment. Where waste be reused, recycled or recovered, the Borwill treat, destroy, or dispose of it in an envisound and safe manner that includes appropriate control of emissions and residues from the handling and processing of the material. If the generated waste is considered hazardous, Borrower will comply with existing requirements management of hazardous wastes including legislation and applicable international including those relating to transmovement. Where such requirements are the Borrower will adopt alternatives for environmentally sound and safe management disposal. When hazardous waste management conducted by third parties, the Borrower will use that are reputable and legitimate enter licensed by the relevant government regulaagencies and, with respect to transportation and For the purposes of such estimate, the Borrower may utilize methodologies accepted in the context of international on climate change, with the agreement of the Bank. epending on the capacity of the Borrower, the type of the projand the basis on which financing is being provided to the this assistance may involve the Bank carrying out the estimation on behalf of the Borrower, for example relating or projects, working with Borrower counterparts and project information provided by the Borrower.

The Borrower will ascertain whether licensed disposal sites are being operated to acceptable standards and where they are, the Borrower will use these sites. Where licensed sites are not being operated to acceptable standards, the Borrower will minimize waste sent to such sites and consider alternative disposal options, including the possibility of developing its own recovery or disposal facilities at the project site or elsewhere. C. Management of chemicals and hazardous materials The Borrower will avoid the manufacture, trade and use of chemicals and hazardous materials subject to international bans, restrictions or phaseouts unless for an acceptable purpose as defined by the conventions or protocols or if an exemption has been obtained by the Borrower, consistent with Borrower government commitments under the applicable international agreements. The Borrower will minimize and control the release and use of hazardous materials. The production, transportation, handling, storage, and use of hazardous materials for project activities will be assessed through the assessment. The Borrower will consider less hazardous substitutes where hazardous materials are intended to be used in manufacturing processes or other operations. d. management of pesticides Where projects involve recourse to pest management measures, the Borrower will give preference to integrated pest management or integrated vector management approaches using combined or multiple tactics. In the procurement of any pesticide the Borrower will assess the nature and degree of associated risks, taking into account the proposed use These materials may include chemical fertilizer, soil amendments and chemicals other than pesticides. Irefers to a mix of farmer-driven, ecologically based pest control practices that seeks to reduce reliance on synthetic chemical pesticides. It involves: managing pests rather than seeking to eradicate them; integrating multiple methods to keep pest populations low; and selecting and applying pesticides, when they have to be used, in a way that minimizes adverse effects on beneficial organisms, humans, and the environment. It is a rational decision-making process for the optimal use of resources for vector control. The approach seeks to improve the efficacy, cost-effectiveness, ecological soundness and sustainability of disease vector control. the intended users. The Borrower will not use pesticides or pesticide products or formulations such use is in compliance with the . addition, the Borrower will also not use any pesproducts that contain active ingredients that restricted under applicable international conventions or their protocols or that are listed in, or the criteria of their annexes, unless for acceptable purpose as defined by such convent heir protocols or annexes, or if an exemphas been obtained by the Borrower under such their protocol or annexes, consistent Borrower commitments under these and other international agreements. The Borrower also not use any formulated pesticide products meet the criteria of carcinogenicity, mutagenicor reproductive toxicity as set forth by relevant agencies. For any other pesticide that poses other potentially serious risk human health or the environment and that are in internationally recognized classificaand labeling systems, the Borrower will not use formulations of products if: the country restrictions on their distribution, management use; or they are likely to be used by, or be to, lay personnel, farmers, or others withtraining, equipment, and facilities to handle, and apply these products properly. The following additional criteria apply to the and use of such pesticides: they will negligible adverse human health effects; will be shown to be effectie against the tarspecies; and they will have minimal effect on species and the natural environment. The timing, and frequency of pesticide application are aimed to minimize damage to natural Pesticides used in public health programs be demonstrated to be safe for inhabitants and animals in the treated areas, as well as personnel applying them; their use will take account the need to prevent the development resistance in pests; and where registration is all pesticides will be registered or other authorized for use on the crops and livestock, for the use patterns, for which they are intended the project. The Borrower will ensure that all pesticides will be manufactured, formulated, packaged, handled, stored, disposed of, and applied to relevant international standards and of conduct, as well as the . his assessment is made in the context of the environmental social impact assessment. For any project involving significant pest management issues or any project contemplating activities that may lead to significant pest and pesticide management issues, the Borrower will Such issues would include: a migratory locust control bmosuito or other disease ector control bird control drodent control, etc. Such as: new land-use development or changed cultivation practices in an area; significant expansion into new areas; cdiersification into new crops in agriculture intensification of existing low-technology systems; proposed procurement of relatively hazardous pest control products or methods; or specific environmental or health concerns . a Pest Management Plan . a pest plan will also be prepared when profinancing of pest control products represents large component of the project. epending on the nature and the scale of the risks and impacts the project, the elements of a may be included as part the and preparation of a stand-alone may not be his is when financing of substantial quantities of pesticides envisaged. a pest management plan is not required for the or use of impregnated bednets for malaria control, of insecticides for intradomiciliary spraying for malaria control in internationally recognized classification systems.

Because, in most\ninstances, habitat loss, degradation or fragmenta-\ntion represents the greatest threat to biodiversity,\nmuch of the focus of biodiversity conservation\nactions is on maintaining or restoring suitable\nhabitats.\n14. This ESS requires a differentiated risk manage-\nment approach to habitats based on their sensitivity\nand values. This ESS addresses all habitats, catego-\nrized as \u2018modified habitat\u2019, \u2018natural habitat\u2019, and\n\u2018critical habitat\u2019, along with \u2018legally protected and\ninternationally and regionally recognized areas of\nbiodiversity value\u2019 which may encompass habitat in\nany or all of these categories.\n15. For the protection and conservation of habitats\nand the biodiversity they support, the mitigation\nhierarchy includes biodiversity offsets. Offsets will\nbe considered as a last resort, only if significant\nresidual adverse impacts remain after all technically\nand financially feasible avoidance, minimization,\nand restoration measures have been considered.\n16. A biodiversity offset will be designed and imple-\nmented to achieve measurable, additional, and long-\nterm conservation outcomes7 that can reasonably\nbe expected to result in no net loss8 and preferably\na net gain9 of biodiversity.

If natural habitats are identified as part of the\nassessment, the Borrower will seek to avoid adverse\nimpacts on them in accordance with the mitigation\nhierarchy.

    "text_clean":"introduction recognizes that protecting and conserving biodiversity and sustainably managing living natural resources are fundamental to sustainable development. Biodiversity is defined as the variability among living organisms from all sources including, inter alia, terrestrial, marine and other aquatic ecosystems and the ecological complexes of which they are a part; this includes diversity within species, between species, and of ecosystems. Biodiversity often underpins ecosystem services valued by humans. Impacts on biodiversity can therefore often adversely affect the delivery of ecosystem services. Requirements related to ecosystem services are set out in . management resources recognizes the importance of maintaining ecological functions of habitats, including forand the biodiversity they support. Habitat is as a terrestrial, freshwater, or marine geounit or airway that supports assemblages living organisms and their interactions with the environment. All habitats support comof living organisms and vary in terms of diversity, abundance and importance. This also addresses sustainable manageof primary production and harvesting of natural resources. recognizes the need to consider the liveof project-affected parties, including Peoples, whose access to, or use of, bioor living natural resources may be affected a project. The potential, positive role of projectparties, including Indigenous Peoples, in conservation and sustainable manageof living natural resources is also considered. To protect and conserve biodiversity and habitats. To apply the mitigation hierarchy and the precautionary approach in the design and implementation of projects that could have an impact on biodiversity. To promote the sustainable management of living natural resources. To support livelihoods of local communities, including Indigenous Peoples, and inclusive economic development, through the adoption of rimary production of living natural resources is cultivation or of plants or animals, including annual and perennial crop animal husbandry , aquaculture, forestry, etc. Harvesting of living natural resources, such as fish and all other of aquatic and terrestrial organisms and timber, refers to activities that include extraction of these resources natural and modified ecosystems and habitats. set out in . practices that integrate conservation needs and development priorities. Scope of application The applicability of this is established during the described in . Based on the , the requirements of this are applied to all projects that potentially affect biodiversity or habitats, either positively or negatively, directly or indirectly, or that depend upon biodiversity for their success. This also applies to projects that involve primary production and or harvesting of living natural resources. requirements a. General The as set out in will consider direct, indirect and cumulative project-related impacts on habitats and the biodiversity they support. This assessment will consider threats to biodiversity, for example habitat loss, degradation and fragmentation, invasive alien species, overexploitation, hydrological changes, nutrient loading, pollution and incidental take, as well as projected climate change impacts. It will determine the significance of biodiversity or habitats based on their vulnerability and irreplaceability at a global, regional or national level and will also take into account the differing values attached to biodiversity and habitats by project-affected parties and other interested parties. The Borrower will avoid adverse impacts on biodiversity and habitats. When avoidance of adverse impacts is not possible, the Borrower will implement measures to minimize adverse impacts and restore biodiversity in accordance with the mitigation hierarchy provided in and with the requirements of this . The Borrower will ensure that competent biodiversity expertise is utilized to conduct the and the verification of the effectiveness and feasibility of mitigation measures. Where significant risks and adverse impacts on biodiversity have been identified, the Borrower will develop and implement a Biodiversity Management Plan. Depending on the nature and the scale of the risks and impacts of the project, the Biodiversity Management Plan may be a standalone document or it may be included as part of the pre pared under . of risks and impacts Through the assessthe Borrower will identify the potential project risks to and impacts on habitats and the that they support. In accordance with mitigation hierarchy, the Borrower will make initial assessment of project risks and impacts taking into account the possibility of biooffsets. The assessment undertaken by Borrower will include identification of the types habitats potentially affected and consideration potential risks to and impacts on the ecological of the habitats. The assessment will encomany areas of potential biodiversity importance may be affected by the project, whether or not are protected under national law. The extent the assessment will be proportionate to the risks impacts, based on their likelihood, significance severity, and will reflect the concerns of project parties and other interested parties. The Borrower\u2019s assessment will include characof baseline conditions to a degree that is and specific to the anticipated risk and of impacts. In planning and undertakenvironmental and social assessment related to biodiversity baseline, the Borrower will follow utilizing desktop review, consultation experts, and field-based approaches, as appro Where further investigations are needed to the significance of potential impacts, the will carry out additional investigation monitoring before undertaking any projectactivities, and before taking irrevocable about project design that could cause adverse impacts to potentially affected and the biodiversity that they support. Where the identified potential risks and impacts on biodior habitats, the Borrower will manage those and impacts in accordance with the mitigahierarchy and . The Borrower will adopt a approach and apply adaptive manpractices in which the implementation of and management measures are responto changing conditions and the results of projmonitoring. iodiversity offsets are measurable conservation outcomes from actions designed to compensate for significant adverse biodiversity impacts arising from project develand persisting after appropriate avoidance, minimization restoration measures have been taken. Therefore, potential should not be considered in determining inherent risks the project. Conservation of biodiversity and habitats \u201cHabitat\u201d is defined as a terrestrial, freshwater, or marine geographical unit or airway that supports assemblages of living organisms and their interactions with the nonliving environment. Habitats vary in their significance for conserving globally, regionally and nationally important biodiversity, their sensitivity to impacts, and in the significance different stakeholders attribute to them. Because, in most instances, habitat loss, degradation or fragmentation represents the greatest threat to biodiversity, much of the focus of biodiversity conservation actions is on maintaining or restoring suitable habitats. This requires a differentiated risk management approach to habitats based on their sensitivity and values. This addresses all habitats, categorized as \u2018modified habitat\u2019, \u2018natural habitat\u2019, and \u2018critical habitat\u2019, along with \u2018legally protected and internationally and regionally recognized areas of biodiversity value\u2019 which may encompass habitat in any or all of these categories. For the protection and conservation of habitats and the biodiversity they support, the mitigation hierarchy includes biodiversity offsets. Offsets will be considered as a last resort, only if significant residual adverse impacts remain after all technically and financially feasible avoidance, minimization, and restoration measures have been considered. Abiodiversity offset will be designed and implemented to achieve measurable, additional, and longterm conservation outcomes that can reasonably be expected to result in no net loss and preferably a net gain of biodiversity. In the case of an offset used as mitigation for residual adverse impacts on any area of critical habitat, a net gain is required. The design of a biodiversity offset will adhere to the Measurable conservation outcomes for biodiversity will be demonstrated in situ and on an appropriate geographic scale . \u2018No net loss\u2019 is defined as the point at which project-related biodiversity losses are balanced by gains resulting from measures taken to avoid and minimize these impacts, to undertake on-site restoration and finally to offset significant residual impacts, if any, on an appropriate geographic scale. 9\u2018 Net gains\u2019 are additional conservation outcomes that can be achieved for the biodiversity values for which the natural or critical habitat was designated. Net gains may be achieved through full application of the mitigation hierarchy that may include the development of a biodiversity offset and or, in instances where the Borrower could meet the reuirements of paragraph of this without a biodiversity offset, through the implementation of additional programs in situ to enhance habitat, and protect and conserve biodiversity. or better\u201d principle and will be carout in alignment with . When a Borrower is considering the developof an offset as part of the mitigation strategy, and qualified experts with demon knowledge in offset design and implementawill be involved. The Borrower will demonstrate long-term technical and financial feasibility of the offset. When offsets are proposed residual adverse impacts on critical habitat, Borrower will engage one or more indepeninternationally recognized experts to advise to whether the proposed offset is feasible and in their professional opinion, it can be reaexpected to result in a sustainable net gain biodiversity values for which the critical habitat designated. Certain residual adverse impacts cannot be offparticularly if the affected area is unique and from a biodiversity standpoint. In such the Borrower will not undertake the project it is redesigned to avoid the need for such and to meet the requirements of this . habitat Modified habitats are areas that may contain a proportion of plant and or animal species of origin, and or where human activity has modified an area\u2019s primary ecological and species composition. Modified habmay include, for example, areas managed for forest plantations, reclaimed coastal and reclaimed wetlands. This applies to those areas of modified that include significant biodiversity value, as by the assess required in . The Borrower will avoid or impacts on such biodiversity and implemitigation measures as appropriate. he principle of \u201clike-for-like or better\u201d means that in most biodiversity offsets should be designed to conserve the biodiversity values that are being affected by the project \u201cin-kind\u201d offset). In certain situations, however, areas of bioto be affected by the project may be neither a national a local priority, and there may be other areas of biodiverwith like values that are a higher priority for conservation sustainable use and under imminent threat or in need of or effective management. In these situations, it may appropriate to consider an \u201cout-of-kind\u201d offset that involves up\u201d . Regardless of type, any considered as offsets for residual adverse impacts in critihabitats will also be critical habitats, meeting the criteria of of this . habitat will not be deemed to be a modified habitat where it been converted in anticipation of the project. eclamation as used in this context is the process of creating land from sea or other aquatic areas for productive use. Natural habitat Natural habitats are areas composed of viable assemblages of plant and or animal species of largely native origin, and or where human activity has not essentially modified an area\u2019s primary ecological functions and species composition. If natural habitats are identified as part of the assessment, the Borrower will seek to avoid adverse impacts on them in accordance with the mitigation hierarchy. Where natural habitats have the potential to be adversely affected by the project, the Borrower will not implement any project-related activities unless: There are no technically and financially feasible alternatives; and Appropriate mitigation measures are put in place, in accordance with the mitigation hierarchy, to achieve no net loss and, where feasible, preferably a net gain of biodiversity over the long term. When residual impacts remain despite best efforts to avoid, minimize and mitigate impacts, and where appropriate and supported by relevant stakeholders, mitigation measures may include biodiversity offsets adhering to the principle of \u201clike-for-like or better.\u201d Critical Habitat Critical habitat is defined as areas with high biodiversity importance or value, including: habitat of significant importance to Critically Endangered or Endangered species, as listed in the Red List of threatened species or equivalent national approaches; habitat of significant importance to endemic or restricted-range species; habitat supporting globally or nationally significant concentrations of migratory or congregatory species; highly threatened or unique ecosystems; ecological functions or characteristics that are needed to maintain the viability of the biodiversity values described above in to . In areas of critical habitat, the Borrower will not implement any project activities that have potential adverse impacts unless all of the following conditions are met: No other viable alternatives within the region exist for development of the project in habitats of lesser biodiversity value; All due process required under international obligations or national law that is a prerequi site to a country granting approval for project activities in or adjacent to a critical habitat has been complied with; The potential adverse impacts, or likelihood of such, on the habitat will not lead to measurable net reduction or negative change in those biodiversity values for which the critical habitat was designated; The project is not anticipated to lead to a net reduction in the population of any Critically Endangered, Endangered, or restricted-range species, over a reasonable time period; The project will not involve significant conversion or significant degradation of critical habitats. In circumstances where the project involves new or renewed forestry or agricultural plantations, it will not convert or degrade any critical habitat; The project\u2019s mitigation strategy will be designed to achieve net gains of those biodiversity values for which the critical habitat was designated; and Arobust and appropriately designed, longterm biodiversity monitoring and evaluation program aimed at assessing the status of the critical habitat is integrated into the Borrower\u2019s management program. Where a Borrower has satisfied the conditions out in paragraph 2, the project\u2019s mitigation will be described in a Biodiversity Man Plan and set out in the legal agreement the ). protected and internationally recognized of high biodiversity value Where the project occurs within or has the to adversely affect an area that is legally designated for protection, or regionally Net reduction is a singular or cumulative loss of individuthat affects the species\u2019 ability to persist at the global regional national scales for many generations or a long period of time.

For species listed on both the Red List and the national regional lists, the net will be based on the national regional population. he time frame in which Borrowers will demonstrate \u201cno net of Critically Endangered and Endangered, endemic restricted-range species will be determined on a case-by-case basis and, where appropriate, in consultation with qualified and taking into account the species\u2019 biology. This recognizes legally protected areas that meet the foldefinition: \u201cAclearly defined geographical space, recogdedicated and managed, through legal or other effective to achieve the long-term conservation of nature with ecosystem services and cultural values.\u201d For the purof this , this includes areas proposed by governments such designation. or internationally recognized, the Borrower will ensure that any activities undertaken are consistent with the area\u2019s legal protection status and management objectives. The Borrower will also identify and assess potential project-related adverse impacts and apply the mitigation hierarchy so as to prevent or mitigate adverse impacts from projects that could compromise the integrity, conservation objectives or biodiversity importance of such an area. The Borrower will meet the requirements of paragraphs through of this , as applicable. In addition, the Borrower will: Demonstrate that the proposed development in such areas is legally permitted; Act in a manner consistent with any government recognized management plans for such areas; Consult and involve protected area sponsors and managers, project-affected parties including Indigenous Peoples, and other interested parties on planning, designing, implementing, monitoring, and evaluating the proposed project, as appropriate; and Implement additional programs, as appropriate, to promote and enhance the conservation aims and effective management of the area. Invasive alien species Intentional or accidental introduction of alien, or non-native, species of flora and fauna into areas where they are not normally found can be a significant threat to biodiversity, since some alien species can become invasive, spreading rapidly and destroying or out-competing native species. The Borrower will not intentionally introduce any new alien species unless this is carried out in accordance with the existing regulatory framework for such introduction. Notwithstanding the above, the Borrower will not deliberately introduce any alien species with a high risk of invasive behavior regardless of whether such introductions are permitted under the existing regulatory framework. All introductions of alien species will be subject to a risk assessment to determine the potential for invasive behavior. The Borrower will implement measures to avoid the potential for accidental or unintended introductions including the transportation of substrates and vectors that may harbor species.

Small scale can be determined by the national context of a country and is generally relative to the average size of landholdings. Where projects involve harvesting of living natural resources, the Borrower will require that these resources are managed in a sustainable manner. In particular, forests and aquatic systems are principal providers of these resources, and need to be managed as specified below. For projects involving industrial-scale commercial forest harvesting operations, the Borrower will ensure such operations are certified under an independent forest certification system or adhere to a time-bound phased action plan acceptable to the Bank for achieving certification to such a system. For projects involving forest harvesting operations conducted by small-scale producers, by local communities under community forest management, or by such entities under joint forest management arrangements, where such operations are not directly associated with an industrial-scale operation, the Borrower will ensure that they: have achieved a standard of sustainable forest management developed with the meaningful participation of project affected parties including Indigenous Peoples, consistent with the principles and criteria of sustainable forest management, even if not formally certified; or adhere to a time bound action plan to achieve such a standard. The action plan will be developed with the meaningful participation of project-affected parties and be acceptable to the Bank. The Borrower will ensure that all such operations are monitored with the meaningful participation of project-affected parties. For projects involving industrial-scale harvesting of fish populations and all other types of marine and freshwater organisms, the Borrower will demonstrate that their activities are being undertaken in a sustainable manner, consistent with the principles and criteria for sustainable harvesting. For projects that do not involve primary production or harvesting of living natural resources and entail salvage logging, for example in areas to be inundated, the Borrower will limit cleared areas to An independent forest certification system will require independent, third-party assessment of forest management performance.

    "text_america":"introduction recognizes that protecting and conserving biodiversity and sustainably managing living natural resources are fundamental to sustainable development. Biodiversity is defined as the variability among living organisms from all sources including, inter alia, terrestrial, marine and other aquatic ecosystems and the ecological complexes of which they are a part; this includes diversity within species, between species, and of ecosystems. Biodiversity often underpins ecosystem services valued by humans. Impacts on biodiversity can therefore often adversely affect the delivery of ecosystem services. Requirements related to ecosystem services are set out in . management resources recognizes the importance of maintaining ecological functions of habitats, including forand the biodiversity they support. Habitat is as a terrestrial, freshwater, or marine geounit or airway that supports assemblages living organisms and their interactions with the environment. All habitats support comof living organisms and vary in terms of diversity, abundance and importance. This also addresses sustainable management of primary production and harvesting of natural resources. recognizes the need to consider the liveof project-affected parties, including Peoples, whose access to, or use of, bioor living natural resources may be affected a project. The potential, positive role of project parties, including Indigenous Peoples, in conservation and sustainable management of living natural resources is also considered. To protect and conserve biodiversity and habitats. To apply the mitigation hierarchy and the precautionary approach in the design and implementation of projects that could have an impact on biodiversity. To promote the sustainable management of living natural resources. To support livelihoods of local communities, including Indigenous Peoples, and inclusive economic development, through the adoption of rimary production of living natural resources is cultivation or of plants or animals, including annual and perennial crop animal husbandry , aquaculture, forestry, etc. Harvesting of living natural resources, such as fish and all other of aquatic and terrestrial organisms and timber, refers to activities that include extraction of these resources natural and modified ecosystems and habitats. set out in . practices that integrate conservation needs and development priorities. Scope of application The applicability of this is established during the described in . Based on the , the requirements of this are applied to all projects that potentially affect biodiversity or habitats, either positively or negatively, directly or indirectly, or that depend upon biodiversity for their success. This also applies to projects that involve primary production and or harvesting of living natural resources. requirements a. General The as set out in will consider direct, indirect and cumulative project-related impacts on habitats and the biodiversity they support. This assessment will consider threats to biodiversity, for example habitat loss, degradation and fragmentation, invasive alien species, overexploitation, hydrological changes, nutrient loading, pollution and incidental take, as well as projected climate change impacts. It will determine the significance of biodiversity or habitats based on their vulnerability and irreplaceability at a global, regional or national level and will also take into account the differing values attached to biodiversity and habitats by project-affected parties and other interested parties. The Borrower will avoid adverse impacts on biodiversity and habitats. When avoidance of adverse impacts is not possible, the Borrower will implement measures to minimize adverse impacts and restore biodiversity in accordance with the mitigation hierarchy provided in and with the requirements of this . The Borrower will ensure that competent biodiversity expertise is utilized to conduct the and the verification of the effectiveness and feasibility of mitigation measures. Where significant risks and adverse impacts on biodiversity have been identified, the Borrower will develop and implement a Biodiversity Management Plan. Depending on the nature and the scale of the risks and impacts of the project, the Biodiversity Management Plan may be a standalone document or it may be included as part of the pre pared under . of risks and impacts Through the assess the Borrower will identify the potential project risks to and impacts on habitats and the that they support. In accordance with mitigation hierarchy, the Borrower will make initial assessment of project risks and impacts taking into account the possibility of biooffsets. The assessment undertaken by Borrower will include identification of the types habitats potentially affected and consideration potential risks to and impacts on the ecological of the habitats. The assessment will encomany areas of potential biodiversity importance may be affected by the project, whether or not are protected under national law. The extent the assessment will be proportionate to the risks impacts, based on their likelihood, significance severity, and will reflect the concerns of project parties and other interested parties. The Borrower\u2019s assessment will include characof baseline conditions to a degree that is and specific to the anticipated risk and of impacts. In planning and undertakenvironmental and social assessment related to biodiversity baseline, the Borrower will follow utilizing desktop review, consultation experts, and field-based approaches, as appropriate Where further investigations are needed to the significance of potential impacts, the will carry out additional investigation monitoring before undertaking any project activities, and before taking irrevocable about project design that could cause adverse impacts to potentially affected and the biodiversity that they support. Where the identified potential risks and impacts on biodior habitats, the Borrower will manage those and impacts in accordance with the mitigahierarchy and . The Borrower will adopt a approach and apply adaptive manpractices in which the implementation of and management measures are responto changing conditions and the results of projmonitoring. iodiversity offsets are measurable conservation outcomes from actions designed to compensate for significant adverse biodiversity impacts arising from project develand persisting after appropriate avoidance, minimization restoration measures have been taken. Therefore, potential should not be considered in determining inherent risks the project. Conservation of biodiversity and habitats \u201cHabitat\u201d is defined as a terrestrial, freshwater, or marine geographical unit or airway that supports assemblages of living organisms and their interactions with the nonliving environment. Habitats vary in their significance for conserving globally, regionally and nationally important biodiversity, their sensitivity to impacts, and in the significance different stakeholders attribute to them. Because, in most instances, habitat loss, degradation or fragmentation represents the greatest threat to biodiversity, much of the focus of biodiversity conservation actions is on maintaining or restoring suitable habitats. This requires a differentiated risk management approach to habitats based on their sensitivity and values. This addresses all habitats, categorized as \u2018modified habitat\u2019, \u2018natural habitat\u2019, and \u2018critical habitat\u2019, along with \u2018legally protected and internationally and regionally recognized areas of biodiversity value\u2019 which may encompass habitat in any or all of these categories. For the protection and conservation of habitats and the biodiversity they support, the mitigation hierarchy includes biodiversity offsets. Offsets will be considered as a last resort, only if significant residual adverse impacts remain after all technically and financially feasible avoidance, minimization, and restoration measures have been considered. a biodiversity offset will be designed and implemented to achieve measurable, additional, and longterm conservation outcomes that can reasonably be expected to result in no net loss and preferably a net gain of biodiversity. In the case of an offset used as mitigation for residual adverse impacts on any area of critical habitat, a net gain is required. The design of a biodiversity offset will adhere to the Measurable conservation outcomes for biodiversity will be demonstrated in situ and on an appropriate geographic scale . \u2018No net loss\u2019 is defined as the point at which project-related biodiversity losses are balanced by gains resulting from measures taken to avoid and minimize these impacts, to undertake on-site restoration and finally to offset significant residual impacts, if any, on an appropriate geographic scale. 9\u2018 Net gains\u2019 are additional conservation outcomes that can be achieved for the biodiversity values for which the natural or critical habitat was designated. Net gains may be achieved through full application of the mitigation hierarchy that may include the development of a biodiversity offset and or, in instances where the Borrower could meet the reuirements of paragraph of this without a biodiversity offset, through the implementation of additional programs in situ to enhance habitat, and protect and conserve biodiversity. or better\u201d principle and will be carout in alignment with . When a Borrower is considering the developof an offset as part of the mitigation strategy, and qualified experts with demon knowledge in offset design and implementawill be involved. The Borrower will demonstrate long-term technical and financial feasibility of the offset. When offsets are proposed residual adverse impacts on critical habitat, Borrower will engage one or more indepeninternationally recognized experts to advise to whether the proposed offset is feasible and in their professional opinion, it can be reaexpected to result in a sustainable net gain biodiversity values for which the critical habitat designated. Certain residual adverse impacts cannot be offparticularly if the affected area is unique and from a biodiversity standpoint. In such the Borrower will not undertake the project it is redesigned to avoid the need for such and to meet the requirements of this . habitat Modified habitats are areas that may contain a proportion of plant and or animal species of origin, and or where human activity has modified an area\u2019s primary ecological and species composition. Modified habmay include, for example, areas managed for forest plantations, reclaimed coastal and reclaimed wetlands. This applies to those areas of modified that include significant biodiversity value, as by the assess required in . The Borrower will avoid or impacts on such biodiversity and implemitigation measures as appropriate. he principle of \u201clike-for-like or better\u201d means that in most biodiversity offsets should be designed to conserve the biodiversity values that are being affected by the project \u201cin-kind\u201d offset). In certain situations, however, areas of bioto be affected by the project may be neither a national a local priority, and there may be other areas of biodiverwith like values that are a higher priority for conservation sustainable use and under imminent threat or in need of or effective management. In these situations, it may appropriate to consider an \u201cout-of-kind\u201d offset that involves up\u201d . Regardless of type, any considered as offsets for residual adverse impacts in critihabitats will also be critical habitats, meeting the criteria of of this . habitat will not be deemed to be a modified habitat where it been converted in anticipation of the project. eclamation as used in this context is the process of creating land from sea or other aquatic areas for productive use. Natural habitat Natural habitats are areas composed of viable assemblages of plant and or animal species of largely native origin, and or where human activity has not essentially modified an area\u2019s primary ecological functions and species composition. If natural habitats are identified as part of the assessment, the Borrower will seek to avoid adverse impacts on them in accordance with the mitigation hierarchy. Where natural habitats have the potential to be adversely affected by the project, the Borrower will not implement any project-related activities unless: There are no technically and financially feasible alternatives; and Appropriate mitigation measures are put in place, in accordance with the mitigation hierarchy, to achieve no net loss and, where feasible, preferably a net gain of biodiversity over the long term. When residual impacts remain despite best efforts to avoid, minimize and mitigate impacts, and where appropriate and supported by relevant stakeholders, mitigation measures may include biodiversity offsets adhering to the principle of \u201clike-for-like or better.\u201d Critical Habitat Critical habitat is defined as areas with high biodiversity importance or value, including: habitat of significant importance to Critically Endangered or Endangered species, as listed in the Red List of threatened species or equivalent national approaches; habitat of significant importance to endemic or restricted-range species; habitat supporting globally or nationally significant concentrations of migratory or congregatory species; highly threatened or unique ecosystems; ecological functions or characteristics that are needed to maintain the viability of the biodiversity values described above in to . In areas of critical habitat, the Borrower will not implement any project activities that have potential adverse impacts unless all of the following conditions are met: No other viable alternatives within the region exist for development of the project in habitats of lesser biodiversity value; All due process required under international obligations or national law that is a prerequi site to a country granting approval for project activities in or adjacent to a critical habitat has been complied with; The potential adverse impacts, or likelihood of such, on the habitat will not lead to measurable net reduction or negative change in those biodiversity values for which the critical habitat was designated; The project is not anticipated to lead to a net reduction in the population of any Critically Endangered, Endangered, or restricted-range species, over a reasonable time period; The project will not involve significant conversion or significant degradation of critical habitats. In circumstances where the project involves new or renewed forestry or agricultural plantations, it will not convert or degrade any critical habitat; The project\u2019s mitigation strategy will be designed to achieve net gains of those biodiversity values for which the critical habitat was designated; and a robust and appropriately designed, longterm biodiversity monitoring and evaluation program aimed at assessing the status of the critical habitat is integrated into the Borrower\u2019s management program. Where a Borrower has satisfied the conditions out in paragraph 2, the project\u2019s mitigation will be described in a Biodiversity Man Plan and set out in the legal agreement the ). protected and internationally recognized of high biodiversity value Where the project occurs within or has the to adversely affect an area that is legally designated for protection, or regionally Net reduction is a singular or cumulative loss of individuthat affects the species\u2019 ability to persist at the global regional national scales for many generations or a long period of time. The scale Red List on regional national lists. For species listed on both the Red List and the national regional lists, the net will be based on the national regional population. he time frame in which Borrowers will demonstrate \u201cno net of Critically Endangered and Endangered, endemic restricted-range species will be determined on a case-by-case basis and, where appropriate, in consultation with qualified and taking into account the species\u2019 biology. This recognizes legally protected areas that meet the foldefinition: \u201ca clearly defined geographical space, recogdedicated and managed, through legal or other effective to achieve the long-term conservation of nature with ecosystem services and cultural values.\u201d For the purof this , this includes areas proposed by governments such designation. or internationally recognized, the Borrower will ensure that any activities undertaken are consistent with the area\u2019s legal protection status and management objectives. The Borrower will also identify and assess potential project-related adverse impacts and apply the mitigation hierarchy so as to prevent or mitigate adverse impacts from projects that could compromise the integrity, conservation objectives or biodiversity importance of such an area. The Borrower will meet the requirements of paragraphs through of this , as applicable. In addition, the Borrower will: Demonstrate that the proposed development in such areas is legally permitted; Act in a manner consistent with any government recognized management plans for such areas; Consult and involve protected area sponsors and managers, project-affected parties including Indigenous Peoples, and other interested parties on planning, designing, implementing, monitoring, and evaluating the proposed project, as appropriate; and Implement additional programs, as appropriate, to promote and enhance the conservation aims and effective management of the area. Invasive alien species Intentional or accidental introduction of alien, or non-native, species of flora and fauna into areas where they are not normally found can be a significant threat to biodiversity, since some alien species can become invasive, spreading rapidly and destroying or out-competing native species. The Borrower will not intentionally introduce any new alien species unless this is carried out in accordance with the existing regulatory framework for such introduction. Notwithstanding the above, the Borrower will not deliberately introduce any alien species with a high risk of invasive behavior regardless of whether such introductions are permitted under the existing regulatory framework. All introductions of alien species will be subject to a risk assessment to determine the potential for invasive behavior. The Borrower will implement measures to avoid the potential for accidental or unintended introductions including the transportation of substrates and vectors that may harbor species. Where alien species are already established the country or region of the proposed project, Borrower will exercise diligence in not spread them into areas in which they have not already established. Where feasible, the Borrower take measures to eradicate such species from natural habitats over which the Borrower has control. management of living resources The Borrower with projects involving priproduction and harvesting of living natural will assess the overall sustainability of activities, as well as their potential impacts local, nearby or ecologically linked habitats, bioand communities, including Indigenous The Borrower will manage living natural in a sustainable manner, through the of good management practices and technologies.

In view of the potential for plantaprojects to introduce invasive alien species and biodiversity, such projects will be designed prevent and mitigate these potential threats to habitats. When the Borrower invests in program forestry in natural forests, these forests will managed sustainably. Small scale can be determined by the national context of a country and is generally relative to the average size of landholdings. Where projects involve harvesting of living natural resources, the Borrower will require that these resources are managed in a sustainable manner. In particular, forests and aquatic systems are principal providers of these resources, and need to be managed as specified below. For projects involving industrial-scale commercial forest harvesting operations, the Borrower will ensure such operations are certified under an independent forest certification system or adhere to a time-bound phased action plan acceptable to the Bank for achieving certification to such a system. For projects involving forest harvesting operations conducted by small-scale producers, by local communities under community forest management, or by such entities under joint forest management arrangements, where such operations are not directly associated with an industrial-scale operation, the Borrower will ensure that they: have achieved a standard of sustainable forest management developed with the meaningful participation of project affected parties including Indigenous Peoples, consistent with the principles and criteria of sustainable forest management, even if not formally certified; or adhere to a time bound action plan to achieve such a standard.

If natural_habitats are identified as part of the assessment, the Borrower will seek to avoid adverse_impacts on them in accordance with the mitigation_hierarchy. Where natural_habitats have the potential to be adversely affected by the project, the Borrower will not implement any project_related activities unless: There are no technically and financially feasible alternatives; and Appropriate_mitigation_measures are put in place, in accordance with the mitigation_hierarchy, to achieve no net_loss and, where feasible, preferably a net_gain of biodiversity over the long_term. When residual impacts remain despite best efforts to avoid, minimize and mitigate impacts, and where appropriate and supported by relevant stakeholders, mitigation_measures may include biodiversity_offsets adhering to the principle of \u201clike_for-like or better.\u201d critical_habitat Critical_habitat is defined as areas with high biodiversity_importance or value, including: habitat of significant importance to Critically Endangered or endangered_species, as listed in the Red List of threatened species or equivalent national approaches; habitat of significant importance to endemic or restricted_range species; habitat supporting globally or nationally significant concentrations of migratory or congregatory_species; highly threatened or unique ecosystems; ecological_functions or characteristics that are needed to maintain the viability of the biodiversity_values described above in to . In areas of critical_habitat, the Borrower will not implement any project_activities that have potential_adverse_impacts unless all of the following conditions are met: No other viable alternatives within the region exist for development of the project in habitats of lesser biodiversity_value; All due process required under international obligations or national_law that is a prerequi site to a country granting approval for project_activities in or adjacent to a critical_habitat has been complied with; The potential_adverse_impacts, or likelihood of such, on the habitat will not lead to measurable net_reduction or negative change in those biodiversity_values for which the critical_habitat was designated; The project is not anticipated to lead to a net_reduction in the population of any Critically Endangered, Endangered, or restricted_range species, over a reasonable time period; The project will not involve significant_conversion or significant degradation of critical_habitats. In circumstances where the project involves new or renewed forestry or agricultural plantations, it will not convert or degrade any critical_habitat; The project\u2019s mitigation strategy will be designed to achieve net_gains of those biodiversity_values for which the critical_habitat was designated; and a robust and appropriately designed, longterm biodiversity monitoring and evaluation program aimed at assessing the status of the critical_habitat is integrated into the Borrower\u2019s management_program.

The Borrower will also identify and assess potential project_related adverse_impacts and apply the mitigation_hierarchy so as to prevent or mitigate adverse_impacts from projects that could compromise the integrity, conservation objectives or biodiversity_importance of such an area. The Borrower will meet the requirements of paragraphs through of this , as applicable. In addition, the Borrower will: Demonstrate that the proposed development in such areas is legally permitted; Act in a manner consistent with any government recognized management_plans for such areas; Consult and involve protected area sponsors and managers, project_affected parties including indigenous_peoples, and other interested_parties on planning, designing, implementing, monitoring, and evaluating the proposed project, as appropriate; and Implement additional programs, as appropriate, to promote and enhance the conservation aims and effective management of the area. Invasive_alien_species Intentional or accidental introduction of alien, or non_native, species of flora and fauna into areas where they are not normally found can be a significant threat to biodiversity, since some alien_species can become invasive, spreading rapidly and destroying or out_competing native species. The Borrower will not intentionally introduce any new alien_species unless this is carried out in accordance with the existing regulatory_framework for such introduction. Notwithstanding the above, the Borrower will not deliberately introduce any alien_species with a high_risk of invasive behavior regardless of whether such introductions are permitted under the existing regulatory_framework. All introductions of alien_species will be subject to a risk_assessment to determine the potential for invasive behavior. The Borrower will implement measures to avoid the potential for accidental or unintended introductions including the transportation of substrates and vectors that may harbor species. Where alien_species are already established the country or region of the proposed project, Borrower will exercise diligence in not spread them into areas in which they have not already established. Where feasible, the Borrower take measures to eradicate such species from natural_habitats over which the Borrower has control. management of living resources The Borrower with projects involving priproduction and harvesting of living natural will assess the overall sustainability of activities, as well as their potential_impacts local, nearby or ecologically linked habitats, bioand communities, including Indigenous The Borrower will manage living natural in a sustainable_manner, through the of good management_practices and technologies. Where such primary propractices are codified in standards that are regionally, or nationally recognized, parfor industrial_scale operations, the Borand the Bank will agree on the standards to applied. In the absence of relevant standards for particular living natural_resources in the country the Borrower will apply . For projects involving small_scale producers, Borrower will require producers to operate in a manner and to gradually improve their where such opportunities exist. Where the consists of a large_number of small producin the same geographical area, the Borrower assess the potential for cumulative risks and Where the project includes commercial agriculture and forestry plantations , the will locate such projects on land that is converted or highly degraded . In view of the potential for plantaprojects to introduce invasive_alien_species and biodiversity, such projects will be designed prevent and mitigate these potential threats to habitats. When the Borrower invests in program forestry in natural forests, these forests will managed sustainably. Small_scale can be determined by the national context of a country and is generally relative to the average size of landholdings. Where projects involve harvesting of living natural_resources, the Borrower will require that these resources are managed in a sustainable_manner. In particular, forests and aquatic systems are principal providers of these resources, and need to be managed as specified below. For projects involving industrial_scale commercial forest_harvesting_operations, the Borrower will ensure such operations are certified under an independent_forest_certification system or adhere to a time_bound phased action_plan acceptable to the Bank for achieving certification to such a system. For projects involving forest_harvesting_operations conducted by small_scale producers, by local_communities under community forest_management, or by such entities under joint forest management_arrangements, where such operations are not directly associated with an industrial_scale operation, the Borrower will ensure that they: have achieved a standard of sustainable_forest_management developed with the meaningful_participation of project affected_parties including indigenous_peoples, consistent with the principles and criteria of sustainable_forest_management, even if not formally certified; or adhere to a time bound action_plan to achieve such a standard. The action_plan will be developed with the meaningful_participation of project_affected parties and be acceptable to the Bank. The Borrower will ensure that all such operations are monitored with the meaningful_participation of project_affected parties. For projects involving industrial_scale harvesting of fish_populations and all other types of marine and freshwater organisms, the Borrower will demonstrate that their activities are being undertaken in a sustainable_manner, consistent with the principles and criteria for sustainable harvesting. For projects that do not involve primary_production or harvesting of living natural_resources and entail salvage_logging, for example in areas to be inundated, the Borrower will limit cleared areas to An independent_forest_certification system will require independent, third_party assessment of forest_management performance.

This requires identifying the need that the project should meet, whether the expected benefits are likely to exceed the costs, and whether the project is necessary for improving social well_being and service_delivery. In this process, government should ensure that delivery_options and financing_arrangements represent the most value_for_money. Well_prepared projects include a clear_rationale for the project, solid_forecasts of payments and costs, and key_performance_indicators factored into a contract between the parties. Beyond the vision and priorities, the institutions should also lay out assumptions, uncertainties, and risks. For instance, the impact of technology, pandemics, and climate_change on the need and operation of infrastructure should be addressed. Finally, given that infrastructure is inherently political, the best_way to provide a coherent_investment should be continuity in the long_run, by ensuring that project_pipelines are derived through a consensus_building process that takes into account long_term needs as understood by stakeholders. Selection of a project should be made on the basis of its contribution to national_welfare, irrespective of how it is financed. While project_selection has unavoidably a political_aspect to it, it is important that it is primarily guided by sound_technical_principles. There should be a link between priorities established through infrastructure_plans, the results of project_appraisals, and the projects selected for implementation. Selection and prioritization is also key in the project_cycle and requires a strong_gatekeeper. This includes a central_entity that ensures the affordability of projects for the public_purse and users, including potential_contingent_liabilities. This function usually sits with the Ministry of Finance or equivalent, and the role includes the aggregation of fiscal_commitments and monitoring of projects\u2019 contingent_liabilities. Evaluating_projects should be linked to the annual and medium_term budget_cycle. The medium_term fiscal_framework and the annual_budget should establish envelopes for infrastructure so that investment_programs are sustainable.

    "text":"DIMENSION 2\nEconomic efficiency and value for money (VfM) over the\ninfrastructure life cycle are important criteria in the choice\nof infrastructure investments.\nDimension 1 focused on whether the project was worth doing from a strategic and overall\neconomic perspective. Dimension 2 focuses on ensuring that the specific project is cost\nefficient and represents value for money. This can be achieved by considering the total\ncost over its life-cycle: (planning, design, finance, construction, operation and mainte-\nnance (O&M), and possible disposal), compared to the value of the asset and its economic,\nenvironmental, and social benefits. Using this approach helps choose between repairing or\nupgrading an existing infrastructure, or launching a new project, as well as choosing among\nfinancing modalities. An initial VfM assessment should be carried out by the implementing\nagency during early stages of project planning and business case development. Later this\nassessment should be updated at the feasibility stage, when more information on the proj-\nect becomes available (financial model or the feasibility study).\nTo attain economic efficiency and value for money, infrastructure projects should pay\nspecial attention to the total cost over their life cycle. As presented in Dimension 1, sound\nappraisal is a crucial part of the preparation phase: Good infrastructure projects should\nbe consistent with government priorities and should increase public welfare, e.g., as doc-\numented through a cost-benefit analysis (CBA), or where costs and benefits are hard to\nmonetize, through cost efficiency or Multi-Criteria Analysis. However, it is also important to\nadopt a full life-cycle perspective and consider the cost of all the required activities (plan-\nning, design, finance, construction, operation, maintenance, and possible disposal) in order\nto attain economic efficiency and value for money. This full perspective supports rational\ndecision-making regarding the need for the investment, and the definition of the best\ntechnological and financing solution.11\n11 ITF (International Transport Forum). 2008. \u201cPrinciples for efficiency in the provision of surface\ntransport infrastructure.\u201d In Transport Infrastructure Investment: Options for Efficiency. Paris:\nOECD Publishing. https:\/\/doi-org.libproxy-wb.imf.org\/10.1787\/9789282101568-6-en.\n\nBOX 4: EFFICIENCY FOR INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT\nThis note is intended as guidance to conducting the InfraSAP 2.0 Gover-\nnance Pillar\/InfraGov assessment. As such, it does not intend to discuss\nin depth the concepts in use because detailed discussions in those can\nbe found elsewhere in the mentioned additional resources. However, it is\nworth briefly noting a few basic ideas regarding the concept of efficien-\ncy in the context of infrastructure investment.\nAccording to the OECD.7 efficiency for investments means \u201csome combi-\nnation of reduced costs and\/or increased benefits to society.\u201d Efficiency\nin the context of investment has, however, two different aspects. On\nthe one hand, \u201callocative efficiency\u201d refers to directing resources to the\nuses that provide the maximum level of welfare. In particular, this requires\nthat that new investments in infrastructure are undertaken only if and\nwhen necessary. For this guidance note, allocative efficiency is mostly\ndealt with in Dimension 1 above. Allocative efficiency also refers to the\nefficient use of existing infrastructure through optimal pricing.\nOn the other hand, \u201cproductive efficiency\u201d refers to cost minimization,\nthat is, once an investment is consider beneficial, it should be carried out\nat the lowest possible cost. Productive efficiency is closely related to\nthe discussion on value for money in Dimension 2 of this guidance note.\nThe full life-cycle cost approach to infrastructure projects helps decide between repairing\n(or upgrading) existing infrastructure or developing a new project. Infrastructure invest-\nment should attain value for money and remain affordable with respect to life-cycle costs\ncompared to the value of the asset as well as its economic, environmental, and social ben-\nefits. The full life-cycle costs and benefits of infrastructure investments should be taken\ninto consideration to ensure the efficiency of investing in a new asset. Construction, oper-\nation and maintenance, and possible disposal costs should be estimated from the onset of\nthe preparation stage to be fully considered.\nConsidering the full life-cycle cost also supports the identification of the most appropri-\nate technological alternative. Different technological solutions may be more or less cap-\nital intensive. For example, more environmentally sustainable infrastructure is often more\ncapital intensive. Without considering the full life-cycle cost of the infrastructure asset,\ngovernments might not choose the best available technology. They may prefer less envi-\nronmentally sustainable solutions because the upfront costs of investment are lower. By\nconsidering the benefits and costs over the whole life of infrastructure assets, technol-\nogies that offer savings in the long run while being also more environmentally friendly are\n\nmore likely to be selected.12 The need to consider the full life-cycle cost should incentivize\nthe identification of efficient alternatives. Additionally, innovative technologies should be\nleveraged throughout the life cycle of infrastructure projects, where appropriate, to raise\neconomic efficiency for existing and new infrastructure. Advanced technologies are an\nimportant component for new and existing assets, and can help to improve data availabil-\nity to monitor infrastructure use, performance, and safety (for more on the importance of\ndata, see Dimension 6).\nEconomic efficiency and value for money through the life cycle of the project should also\nbe key to a process that agnostically guides the decision on how to provide the infra-\nstructure service and in the role of the private sector. There is a wide range of delivery\noptions with varying degrees of private participation. At one end of the spectrum are\ngovernment-built and -operated infrastructure assets, followed by public work contracts,\ngovernment-pays-type public-private partnerships (PPPs), concessions that are main-\nly user-funded, utilities with dedicated regulators, and, finally, fully privatized activities\nwith general regulators. At any point on this continuum, SOEs may operate as the public\nside, the private side, or both. The financing and the funding for these options may also\nvary, ranging from direct subsidies, guarantees, availability-based payments, take-or-pay\narrangements, etc. The choice of modality to deliver the asset is thus related both to fi-\nnancial and funding objectives\u2014e.g., crowding in the private sector to free public funds\u2014as\nwell as more sectoral policy issues, such as introducing more competition or enlarging the\nscope for the private sector in order to create a more vibrant market economy. Undoubt-\nedly, the choice of modality is often also influenced by the political and economic legacy\nof the country (e.g. preference for private sector solutions versus delivery through SOEs).\nHowever, it remains important that life-cycle VfM should still remain the guiding principle of\nthis decision.\nOne important objective is to deliver infrastructure services to the public at the lowest\ncost (either to the users or to the taxpayers as a whole when funded by the government),\nwith sufficient quality: The choice of delivery mode should thus be based on value for mon-\ney.13 It is important to focus on the sources of possible efficiency gains from private financ-\ning. These can arise from the bundling of asset design with service delivery, or from private\noperators\u2019 operational or administrative efficiencies or technical expertise. Although the\npublic sector may have lower financing costs (depending on the sovereign credit rating),\nefficiency gains from private participation may outweigh the extra costs. However, in many\ncountries the choice of modality is based on informal processes or on the way things are\n\u201cusually done.\u201d\n12 Rozenberg, J., and M. Fay. 2019.

OECD Principles for Pri-\nvate Participation in Infrastructure. Paris: OECD.\n\nIn many cases, the decision to pursue PPPs may be based on a short-term view that\nemphasizes the lower impact on the public budget through PPP procurement. However, in\npresent value terms the fiscal cost of the infrastructure investment is essentially the same\n(just spread over time), unless there are material differences in efficiency. In this sense, it\nis important to acknowledge the presence of this potential PPP bias and strive for deci-\nsion-making processes that privilege value for money over political reasons.\nBOX 5: DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO DEFINE VALUE FOR MONEY\n(IN PARTICULAR FOR PPPS)\nSome jurisdictions have clearly defined criteria to preform qualitative as-\nsessments of value for money to ensure that PPP is the right delivery\noption. For example, in France, preliminary analysis of a PPP requires as-\nsessing several criteria divided in three different categories, PPP rele-\nvance (i.e. appropriateness of and integrated approach to manage the\nproject), commercial attractiveness and potential to optimal risk allo-\ncation. Public sector comparators and other more quantitative analysis\nof value for money are required by some countries, like for example Aus-\ntralia (that use the Public Sector Comparator against received bids) and\nNew Zealand that directly uses cost benefit analysis as the main tool to\nasses procurement options.\nSource: World Bank PPP Reference Guide\nTo ensure that every option to deliver infrastructure assets is examined, the government\nmust build sufficient capacity, incentives, and opportunities for public entities to under-\ntake such work and be able to present suitable choices to the decision-makers. This will\noften require an explicit commitment to examine new types of delivery mechanisms and,\ninitially, to create dedicated units of expertise. Ideally, all infrastructure investment worth\nundertaking\u2014given their overall economic benefits and alignment with government prior-\nities\u2014should be screened to assess at an early stage what delivery alternative appears\nmore appropriate. An initial value for money assessment should then be carried out by\nthe implementing agency during the early stages of project planning, and a business case\nshould be developed to justify the selected delivery modality. This assessment should be\nupdated at the feasibility stage, when more information on the project has become avail-\nable (financial model or the feasibility study). Value for money assessments\u2014for example,\nusing a public sector comparator and, ideally, relying on both quantitative and qualitative\nindicators (as they become available)\u2014will help more rationally choose among delivery and\nfinancing alternatives, taking into considerations such as differential financing cost and\npotential efficiency gains.\n\nTABLE 3\nKey Questions and Indicators for Dimension 2\nKEY QUESTIONS*\n(cid:0) Are there mechanisms and capacity in place to estimate construction, O&M, and possible\ndisposal costs from the onset?\n(cid:0) Is a cost-benefit analysis used to consider the life-cycle costs and benefits of\ninfrastructure projects?\n(cid:0) Are innovative technologies leveraged throughout the life cycle of infrastructure projects,\nwhere adequate, to increase the economic efficiency of existing and new projects?\n(cid:0) Is the procurement of assets and the allocation of risks and rewards to the public or private\nsectors, public corporations, or others based on an unbiased, data-driven gateway process,\nat the center of the government?\n(cid:0) Is there a process that agnostically guides the decision on how to provide the infrastructure\nservice, and the role of the private sector, prioritizing VfM analysis?\n(cid:0) Are unsolicited proposals (USPs) subjected to a VfM analysis considering alternative\nfinancing modalities?\nKEY INDICATORS^\n(cid:0) Benchmarking Infrastructure Development TPI Survey (available for 40 economies; source:\nWorld Bank)\n(cid:0) Question 6.1 and 6.2 on evaluation of procurement alternatives\n(cid:0) Question 12.1 on socioeconomic assessment and methodology\n(cid:0) Question 12.2 on risk assessment and methodology\n(cid:0) Question 12.4 on market sounding to identify solutions and available technology\n(cid:0) Benchmarking Infrastructure Development PPP Survey (available for 140 economies;\nsource: World Bank)\n(cid:0) Question 7 and 7.2 on PPP approval by the Ministry of Finance\n(cid:0) Question 10.1 on socioeconomic assessment and methodology\n(cid:0) Question 10.3 on risk assessment and methodology\n(cid:0) Question 10.4 on comparative assessment (value for money assessment)\n(cid:0) Question 10.7 on market sounding to identify solutions and available technology\n(cid:0) Question 48 on evaluation of USPs\n*For an extended list of guiding questions and non-standard indicators, see Appendix A.\n^For the specific questionnaires on which the indicators are based, see Appendix B.\n\n\n\nDIMENSION 3\nThe fiscal affordability and fiscal sustainability of infrastruc-\nture projects should be assessed and managed throughout\ntheir life cycle.\nFor specific projects to be fiscally affordable, it is essential that the appraisal and selec-\ntion process is linked to the budget cycle, even though the project evaluation cycle may\nrun along a different timetable. Multiyear budgeting facilitates this integration by allocat-\ning funds for project implementation over the medium term. The macro-fiscal implications\nof individual projects should be carefully assessed\u2014i.e., their impact on a country\u2019s fiscal\ndeficit, its gross and net debt, and the stock and flows of nondebt liabilities and contin-\ngent liabilities for government within the context of an adequate institutional setting (i.e.,\nproviding enough authority to the Ministry of Finance). Finally, during the life cycle of infra-\nstructure projects, proper control, monitoring, and reporting mechanisms on public\ncommitments and contingent liabilities are key, in particular for PPPs. All this should\ncontribute to the fiscal sustainability of projects, including those that aim to crowd in\nmore private investments.\nFor specific projects to be affordable, it is essential that the appraisal and selection pro-\ncess is linked in an appropriate way to the budget cycle, even though the project evalua-\ntion cycle may run along a different timetable. To assist a country in maintaining a sustain-\nable fiscal path, the fiscal framework and the annual budget may establish envelopes for\ninfrastructure investment (on an aggregate and sector basis). These envelopes should be\nlinked to a long-term strategy informed by fiscal objectives and be consistent with numeri-\ncal fiscal rules where they exist. An optimal integration of budgetary and public investment\nmanagement processes will help ensure that projects are not considered for inclusion in\nthe budget prior to completion of a thorough evaluation that provides a full understanding\nregarding their fiscal implications.\nMultiyear budgeting facilitates allocation of funds for project implementation over a proj-\nect\u2019s life cycle. Ideally, investment plans should be grounded in adequately detailed and\nrealistically formulated medium-term expenditure frameworks (MTEFs).14 Such frameworks\nshould be based on prudent forecasts of available tax and non-tax resources, and on the\nendogenous growth of entitlement programs and other determinants of current spending.\nIt is especially important that the frameworks make allowance for capital spending already\nin the pipeline, and for adequate levels of spending on operation and maintenance of both\nexisting capital stock and proposed new investments. MTEFs should also be accompanied\nby sensitivity and scenario analyses of the impact of contingent liabilities and other major\nrisks on the fiscal space available for new investments.\n14 See World Bank. 2013. Beyond the Annual Budget: Global Experience with Medium-Term Expenditure\nFrameworks. Washington, DC: World Bank., for a comprehensive discussion of the challenges of\npreparing sound MTEFs.\n\nPhoto: Dominic Chavez \/ International Finance Corporation\nThe impact on fiscal affordability and financial sustainability of individual projects should\nbe considered in the prioritization of potential infrastructure projects, subject to available\noverall financing. In addition to project-level financial sustainability, the impact of publicly\nfunded infrastructure projects, and of possible contingent liabilities, on macro-level debt\nsustainability, needs to be considered and transparent, given that infrastructure invest-\nment can have significant impacts on public finance. This will contribute to attaining value\nfor money that considers life-cycle cost, promoting fiscal sustainability, saving fiscal space\nfor future potential projects, and crowding in more private investments. A functionally\nintegrated and transparent decision-making framework for infrastructure investments\nmust consider both operation and maintenance and new investments to ensure efficient\nresource allocation. This includes a centrally placed entity that factors in both the afford-\nability of projects and the potential contingent liabilities arising from them. This function\nusually sits with the budget directorate in the Ministry of Finance equivalent, and its role\nincludes the aggregation of fiscal and financial\/contractual commitments and monitoring\nof projects\u2019 contingent liabilities.\nProper control, monitoring, and reporting on public commitments arising from infrastruc-\nture projects are key, in particular for PPPs that, absent clear mechanisms, could be\nutilized to circumvent conventional budgetary and accounting controls. PPP and other\nalternative delivery methods should be pursued when they generate efficiency gains and\noffer better value for money for the government and the citizen than traditional budgetary\ninvestments. However, the distinctive PPPs\/project financing time structure of payments\nmay fall outside conventional budgetary\/accounting controls for infrastructure projects.\nThis results in a potential incentive to use PPPs precisely with that aim, to circumvent fiscal\ncontrols. In order to avoid any unwarranted bias, all public commitments originating from\na PPP need to be fully understood, including (among others): direct upfront commitments\n(for example, a capital subsidy); direct long-term commitments (for example, availability\npayments); explicit contingent liabilities\n\n(for example, in the form of guarantees of different types, as in a minimum revenue guar-\nantee for a toll road); foregone revenue (when the right to charge a fee is granted to the\nprivate party); and even implicit contingent liabilities (bailouts due to the public and tax-\npayer public service expectations). To this end, there needs to be specific systems tailored\nto the financing of PPPs: caps on PPP spending, accounting and reporting mechanisms for\nPPPs, disclosure of information on PPP-related public liabilities, full integration of the PPP in\nthe budgetary cycle to ensure unity and comprehensiveness of the public budget, etc.\nTABLE 4\nKey Questions and Indicators for Dimension 3\nKEY QUESTIONS*\n(cid:0) Is there a mid-to-long-term plan for infrastructure asset creation \/operation integrated into\nthe annual budget process?\n(cid:0) Are there multiyear budgetary commitments that eliminate the risk of not having a budget\navailable for infrastructure projects from one year to the other?\n(cid:0) Is there an affordability analysis undertaken to ensure that projects are affordable to the\npublic purse and\/or users?\n(cid:0) Does the government employ a fiscal rule or fiscal ceiling in capping spending on PPPs?\n(cid:0) Is there a methodology for identifying, accounting for, and managing contingent liabilities?\n(cid:0) Is there a high degree of budget transparency with respect to infrastructure spending and\ncommitments, including off-budget, extra-budgetary, externally funded, and PPPs?\nKEY INDICATORS^\n(cid:0) Benchmarking Infrastructure Development TPI Survey (available for 40 economies; source:\nWorld Bank)\n(cid:0) Question 5 on national\/sectoral strategies for infrastructure investment\n(cid:0) Question 8 on budgeting for infrastructure investment\n(cid:0) Benchmarking Infrastructure Development PPP Survey (available for 140 economies; source:\nWorld Bank)\n(cid:0) Question 7 and 7.2 on PPP approval by the Ministry of Finance\n(cid:0) Question 7.4 and 7.5 on budgeting, accounting, and reporting for PPPs\n(cid:0) Question 10.2 on fiscal affordability assessment\n(cid:0) Public Investment Management Assessment (PIMA) (available for 80 countries, only 17\npublished; source: International Monetary Fund)\n(cid:0) A.1 Fiscal targets and rules\n(cid:0) B.6.

These envelopes should be linked to a long-term strategy informed by fiscal objectives and be consistent with numerical fiscal rules where they exist. An optimal integration of budgetary and public investment management processes will help ensure that projects are not considered for inclusion in the budget prior to completion of a thorough evaluation that provides a full understanding regarding their fiscal implications. Multiyear budgeting facilitates allocation of funds for project implementation over a project\u2019s life cycle. Ideally, investment plans should be grounded in adequately detailed and realistically formulated medium-term expenditure frameworks . Such frameworks should be based on prudent forecasts of available tax and non-tax resources, and on the endogenous growth of entitlement programs and other determinants of current spending. It is especially important that the frameworks make allowance for capital spending already in the pipeline, and for adequate levels of spending on operation and maintenance of both existing capital stock and proposed new investments. should also be accompanied by sensitivity and scenario analyses of the impact of contingent liabilities and other major risks on the fiscal space available for new investments.

Photo: Dominic Chavez International Finance Corporation The impact on fiscal affordability and financial sustainability of individual projects should be considered in the prioritization of potential infrastructure projects, subject to available overall financing. In addition to project-level financial sustainability, the impact of publicly funded infrastructure projects, and of possible contingent liabilities, on macro-level debt sustainability, needs to be considered and transparent, given that infrastructure investment can have significant impacts on public finance. This will contribute to attaining value for money that considers life-cycle cost, promoting fiscal sustainability, saving fiscal space for future potential projects, and crowding in more private investments. Afunctionally integrated and transparent decision-making framework for infrastructure investments must consider both operation and maintenance and new investments to ensure efficient resource allocation. This includes a centrally placed entity that factors in both the affordability of projects and the potential contingent liabilities arising from them.

    "text_america":"Economic efficiency and value for money over the infrastructure life cycle are important criteria in the choice of infrastructure investments. Dimension focused on whether the project was worth doing from a strategic and overall economic perspective. Dimension focuses on ensuring that the specific project is cost efficient and represents value for money. This can be achieved by considering the total cost over its life-cycle: , and possible disposal), compared to the value of the asset and its economic, environmental, and social benefits. Using this approach helps choose between repairing or upgrading an existing infrastructure, or launching a new project, as well as choosing among financing modalities. An initial assessment should be carried out by the implementing agency during early stages of project planning and business case development. Later this assessment should be updated at the feasibility stage, when more information on the project becomes available . To attain economic efficiency and value for money, infrastructure projects should pay special attention to the total cost over their life cycle. As presented in Dimension 1, sound appraisal is a crucial part of the preparation phase: Good infrastructure projects should be consistent with government priorities and should increase public welfare, e.g., as documented through a cost-benefit analysis , or where costs and benefits are hard to monetize, through cost efficiency or Multi-Criteria Analysis. However, it is also important to adopt a full life-cycle perspective and consider the cost of all the required activities in order to attain economic efficiency and value for money. This full perspective supports rational decision-making regarding the need for the investment, and the definition of the best technological and financing solution. . \u201cPrinciples for efficiency in the provision of surface transport infrastructure.\u201d In Transport Infrastructure Investment: Options for Efficiency. Paris: Publishing. This note is intended as guidance to conducting the InfraSAP Governance Pillar Infra Gov assessment. As such, it does not intend to discuss in depth the concepts in use because detailed discussions in those can be found elsewhere in the mentioned additional resources. However, it is worth briefly noting a few basic ideas regarding the concept of efficiency in the context of infrastructure investment. According to the . efficiency for investments means \u201csome combination of reduced costs and or increased benefits to society.\u201d Efficiency in the context of investment has, however, two different aspects. On the one hand, \u201callocative efficiency\u201d refers to directing resources to the uses that provide the maximum level of welfare. In particular, this requires that that new investments in infrastructure are undertaken only if and when necessary. For this guidance note, allocative efficiency is mostly dealt with in Dimension above. Allocative efficiency also refers to the efficient use of existing infrastructure through optimal pricing. On the other hand, \u201cproductive efficiency\u201d refers to cost minimization, that is, once an investment is consider beneficial, it should be carried out at the lowest possible cost. Productive efficiency is closely related to the discussion on value for money in Dimension of this guidance note. The full life-cycle cost approach to infrastructure projects helps decide between repairing existing infrastructure or developing a new project. Infrastructure investment should attain value for money and remain affordable with respect to life-cycle costs compared to the value of the asset as well as its economic, environmental, and social benefits. The full life-cycle costs and benefits of infrastructure investments should be taken into consideration to ensure the efficiency of investing in a new asset. Construction, operation and maintenance, and possible disposal costs should be estimated from the onset of the preparation stage to be fully considered. Considering the full life-cycle cost also supports the identification of the most appropriate technological alternative. Different technological solutions may be more or less capital intensive. For example, more environmentally sustainable infrastructure is often more capital intensive. Without considering the full life-cycle cost of the infrastructure asset, governments might not choose the best available technology. They may prefer less environmentally sustainable solutions because the upfront costs of investment are lower. By considering the benefits and costs over the whole life of infrastructure assets, technologies that offer savings in the long run while being also more environmentally friendly are more likely to be selected. The need to consider the full life-cycle cost should incentivize the identification of efficient alternatives. Additionally, innovative technologies should be leveraged throughout the life cycle of infrastructure projects, where appropriate, to raise economic efficiency for existing and new infrastructure. Advanced technologies are an important component for new and existing assets, and can help to improve data availability to monitor infrastructure use, performance, and safety . Economic efficiency and value for money through the life cycle of the project should also be key to a process that agnostic ally guides the decision on how to provide the infrastructure service and in the role of the private sector. There is a wide range of delivery options with varying degrees of private participation. At one end of the spectrum are government-built and -operated infrastructure assets, followed by public work contracts, government-pays-type public-private partnerships , concessions that are mainly user-funded, utilities with dedicated regulators, and, finally, fully privatized activities with general regulators. At any point on this continuum, may operate as the public side, the private side, or both. The financing and the funding for these options may also vary, ranging from direct subsidies, guarantees, availability-based payments, take-or-pay arrangements, etc. The choice of modality to deliver the asset is thus related both to financial and funding objectives\u2014e.g., crowding in the private sector to free public funds\u2014as well as more sectoral policy issues, such as introducing more competition or enlarging the scope for the private sector in order to create a more vibrant market economy. Undoubtedly, the choice of modality is often also influenced by the political and economic legacy of the country . However, it remains important that life-cycle should still remain the guiding principle of this decision. One important objective is to deliver infrastructure services to the public at the lowest cost , with sufficient quality: The choice of delivery mode should thus be based on value for money. It is important to focus on the sources of possible efficiency gains from private financing. These can arise from the bundling of asset design with service delivery, or from private operators\u2019 operational or administrative efficiencies or technical expertise. Although the public sector may have lower financing costs , efficiency gains from private participation may outweigh the extra costs. However, in many countries the choice of modality is based on informal processes or on the way things are \u201cusually done.\u201d Rozenberg, J., and M. Fay. Beyond the Gap: How Countries Can Afford the Infrastructure They Need while Protecting the Planet. Washington, : World Bank. . Recommendation of the Council on Principles for Public Governance of Public-Private Partnerships. Principles for Private Participation in Infrastructure. Paris: . In many cases, the decision to pursue may be based on a short-term view that emphasizes the lower impact on the public budget through procurement. However, in present value terms the fiscal cost of the infrastructure investment is essentially the same , unless there are material differences in efficiency. In this sense, it is important to acknowledge the presence of this potential bias and strive for decision-making processes that privilege value for money over political reasons. Some jurisdictions have clearly defined criteria to preform qualitative assessments of value for money to ensure that is the right delivery option. For example, in France, preliminary analysis of a requires assessing several criteria divided in three different categories, relevance , commercial attractiveness and potential to optimal risk allocation. Public sector comparators and other more quantitative analysis of value for money are required by some countries, like for example Australia and New Zealand that directly uses cost benefit analysis as the main tool to asses procurement options. Source: World Bank Reference Guide To ensure that every option to deliver infrastructure assets is examined, the government must build sufficient capacity, incentives, and opportunities for public entities to undertake such work and be able to present suitable choices to the decision-makers. This will often require an explicit commitment to examine new types of delivery mechanisms and, initially, to create dedicated units of expertise. Ideally, all infrastructure investment worth undertaking\u2014given their overall economic benefits and alignment with government priorities\u2014should be screened to assess at an early stage what delivery alternative appears more appropriate. An initial value for money assessment should then be carried out by the implementing agency during the early stages of project planning, and a business case should be developed to justify the selected delivery modality. This assessment should be updated at the feasibility stage, when more information on the project has become available . Value for money assessments\u2014for example, using a public sector comparator and, ideally, relying on both quantitative and qualitative indicators \u2014will help more rationally choose among delivery and financing alternatives, taking into considerations such as differential financing cost and potential efficiency gains.

    "text":"DIMENSION 6\nInfrastructure procurement and contract management\nsystems should be efficient, high quality, and should support\ncompetition and transparency.\nWhether infrastructure projects are delivered using public procurement, or through PPPs\nand other types of hybrid arrangements, a high-quality process will ensure that infrastruc-\nture projects provide good value for money, are safe and effective, and that investment\nexpenditures are not diverted inappropriately. Creating a level playing field in procurement\nensures that the government receives strong proposals\/bids of high quality and that it can\naward the contract to the most advantageous bidder. To this end, the government has\nto ensure that procurement documents are of high quality, set competitive bidding con-\nditions, use transparent evaluation criteria that are fit for purpose, implement integrated\ne-procurement solutions, and efficiently manage the contract. Competitive bidding re-\nquires the convergence of several criteria, such as a good level of technical depth in the\nrequests for proposals, enough time to prepare the proposals, rigorous evaluation of pro-\nposals, pre-disclosed contract conditions and risks, etc. Bidders need to be treated equally\nand fairly, the rules of the game need to be clear and adhered to, and the process needs\nto be conducted transparently. E-procurement systems should be implemented to pro-\nmote efficiency, integrity, and transparency of infrastructure governance, and to provide\nan interface with financial management systems to enhance commitment controls. The\nsystems have to be clear, straightforward, and user-friendly, and they must cover the core\nfunctions throughout the procurement and contract management cycle.\nThe procurement dimension is meant to ensure that infrastructure procurement is man-\naged efficiently and in the interest of the public, taking into consideration costs across\nthe project life cycle. High-quality, efficient, competitive, and transparent public pro-\ncurement systems enable governments to fulfill their core functions, such as delivering\ninfrastructure services to citizens; generate trust in government; and create a favorable\nbusiness environment. Procurement systems must ensure that investments attain value\nfor money and remain affordable with respect to life-cycle costs, taking into account the\ntotal cost over its life cycle (including planning, design, finance, construction, operation and\nmaintenance, and possible disposal) compared to the value of the asset and its econom-\nic, environmental, and social benefits (for more on value for money considering life-cycle\ncost, see Dimension 2).15 Although procurement systems differ across countries, the need\nfor sound regulation and good practices in public procurement is universal. The framework\nassesses procurement effectiveness based on the quality of procurement documents,\nclear and robust contract settings and monitoring practices, promotion of competition,\nand implementation of innovative practices, such as e-procurement, that reduce the costs\nand risks associated with procurement. The assessment looks at all of the above aspects\nof procurement, in the case of Public Investment Management systems, and for PPPs or\nsimilar arrangements, which in certain countries have a separate framework.\n15 G20 Principles for Quality Infrastructure Investment, Principle 2: Raising Economic Efficiency in View f\nLife-Cycle Cost, p. 2.\n\nThe legal and regulatory framework of infrastructure procurement should be clear, hier-\narchical, coherent, and non-discriminatory. The legal framework should ensure that there\nis a clear linkage between budget planning and formulation and preparation of the annual\nprocurement plans (for more details on the investment planning process, see Dimension 1;\nbudgetary issues are also discussed in Dimension 3 in the context of fiscal sustainability). It\nis also important that stakeholders have access to all the documents and regulations gov-\nerning procurement in infrastructure. Changes to the relevant legal and regulatory frame-\nwork should be discussed with relevant stakeholders and clearly disseminated on the gov-\nernments\u2019 web portals. The legal and regulatory framework should be effectively enforced.\nThe government is responsible for ensuring that norms and regulations are being followed\nby procurement agencies and others. If there are any exceptions to competitive tendering,\nthose should only be applied where justified by legal frameworks and clearly laid out.\nIn order to attract high-quality bids, and ensure high-quality infrastructure outputs, pro-\ncurement documentation should have accurate project specifications and clearly outlined\nexpected deliverables and timelines. Potential bidders assess the quality of documenta-\ntion not only to ensure that the bidding is competitive, but also because poor information\ncan result in wasted resources and later lead to claims. If the contractors have enough\ninformation, they develop a more precise budget and project specifications. On the other\nhand, the government can only hold bidders accountable if the deliverables and timelines\nare clearly defined and when they have a clear understanding of a project\u2019s progress.\nTender documents therefore play a crucial role in the success of a tender, as well as in the\nquality of the project overall.16 They typically comprise of bill of quantities\/schedule of rates\n(in the case of construction), drawings, instructions to tenderers, specifications, form\nof contract, conditions of contract, and a list of required documents.17 \u201cQuality of docu-\nmentation\u201d means that the information provided is clear and consistent; and that there\nis sufficient detail to allow companies to respond to requirements and submit responsive\nbids, develop an adequate design, and understand the price ranges.18 In order to attract\nprivate companies, the procurement procedure should be, clear, fair, simple, and account-\nable. Moreover, tendering specifications (in the case of goods\/supplies) should be neutral\nand provide detailed guidance on the expected outputs so as to stimulate high-quality\nproposals. Efficient practices should be maintained throughout the public procurement life\ncycle to ensure that the rules of the game are clear and unbiased, and that sensible and\nexpedient review and payment procedures are used.\n16 The correlation between better procurement documentation and higher quality infrastructure\noutputs has been studied since the 1970s. For instance, the Coordinating Committee for Project\nInformation (CPI) published its recommendations on how to improve documentation for construc-\ntion projects back in 1987. CPI. 1987. Co-ordinating Committee for Project Information. Coordinated\nProject Information for Building Works.\n17 Mohammed, H.H., A.H. Ibrahim, and A.E. El-Malt. 2019. \u201cAssessment of Tender Documents Quality\nIndex.\u201d American Journal of Civil Engineering and Architecture, 7(4): 172-180.\n18 MAPS criteria 1(e)(a).\n\nTo hold companies accountable after the contract award, the procuring authorities should\nestablish key performance indicators and reporting procedures, and set measurable out-\nputs. Contracts should provide information that enables participants to understand the\nallocation of risk between parties to a contract as well as other obligations that the signa-\ntories to the contract will incur.19 They should set clear timelines and review points that al-\nlow the procuring authority, or an independent review body, to assess the deliverables and\nformulate opinions. In certain cases, procuring authorities may implement a pay-for-per-\nformance approach as part of the contractual terms. This allows them to better align the\nincentives of companies with the public interest. While increasing transparency during the\nproject planning process, governments should preserve the flexibility to control key planning\nlevers such as user fees, service coordination, and facility expansion.20 Contracts should be\nsubject to independent and unbiased selective internal and external audit to ensure over-\nsight and provide a platform for further improving procurement practices. Contract condi-\ntions should also cover some practical aspects of contract implementation\u2014e.g., general\nconditions on inspection, quality control and final acceptance of products, and procedures\nrelating to invoicing and payment, as well as provisions on dispute resolution (for more de-\ntails on contract management and implementation, see Dimension 9).\nTo strengthen competitiveness, fair and transparent rules of the game should be ensured,\nincluding at the pre- and post-tender stage. Stimulating competition in public procurement\nis critical to ensuring that the project represents value for money. However, when suitable\nreturns on investments require a longer time horizon, experience shows that governments\nmay struggle to attract enough private actors willing to bid for the project, limiting compe-\ntition. It is the responsibility of the government to carefully assess how to make the offer\nmore attractive and to make every effort to ensure that, despite the risks associated with\nthe project and\/or lower rates of return, the private sector is willing to participate. Apart\nfrom the monetary award, signaling the transparency and openness of procurement prac-\ntices can assist in attracting serious private actors. This requires, first, that information\nabout tenders and their procedures is available openly and freely, that companies are able\nto participate in tenders without considerable barriers, and that the companies receive fair\ntreatment. Second, the government should set out clear evaluation criteria and weightings\nattached to price and quality, and it should ensure the integrity and fairness of the pro-\ncess. If there is any regulation providing preferential treatment to domestic companies, it\nshould not be to the detriment of competition and integrity, and the regulation should be\npre-disclosed. Local content criteria should be used purposefully and with the public inter-\nest foremost, and such criteria should not create a long-term imbalance that undermines\nthe market. Additional instruments can assist with ensuring competitive conditions. Those\ncan include allowing companies to ask questions directly from the procuring authority in an\nopen forum, making information about contract awards and contracts publicly available,\nand setting up an unbiased complaint review process.\n19 MAPS criterion 2(c).\n20 Siemiatycki, M., and N. Farooqi. 2012. \u201cValue for Money and Risk in Public\u2013Private Partnerships:\nEvaluating the Evidence.\u201d Journal of the American Planning Association, 78(3): 286-299.\n\nFor infrastructure procurement to be efficient, of high quality, transparent, and competi-\ntive, governments should use digital technology that allows for integrated e-procurement\nsolutions for the public procurement cycle. E-procurement systems are effective tools\nto improve efficiency, transparency, and integrity. E-procurement can consolidate and\nstreamline a number of processes, offering an end-to-end solution for conducting busi-\nness. If implemented properly, e-procurement can drive cost savings and increase compe-\ntition. In its limited version, it includes a digital platform for searching, submitting, and eval-\nuating bids. The more expansive system includes searching, sourcing, negotiating, ordering,\nreceiving, and conducting post-purchase reviews.21 To understand a country\u2019s progress in\nimplementing e-procurement technologies, this framework looks at what information on\ntenders is publicly available and which stages of procurement are carried out online.\nE-procurement tools should offer simple and user-friendly solutions for doing business.\nInformation technology should be used to ensure supplying the core capabilities and\nfunctions that allow business innovation. It is important that it does not create additional\nbarriers for small and medium-sized enterprises. To this end, e-procurement tools should\nbe simple to use and appropriate to their purpose.22 Where possible, procurement systems\nshould be consistent across procurement agencies. It is important that e-procurement\nsystems are secure and technologically neutral, allow for inter-operability with other sys-\ntems, ensure an audit trail, and facilitate reasonable cost and ease of participation. They\nmust offer public access to information (often inclusive of contract awards), and at the\nsame time they must ensure fair treatment without exposing bidders\u2019 commercially\nsensitive information.\n21 Vaidya, K., A.S.M.

    "text_ngram":"Infrastructure_procurement and contract_management systems should be efficient, high_quality, and should support competition and transparency. Whether infrastructure_projects are delivered using public_procurement, or through and other types of hybrid arrangements, a high_quality process will ensure that infrastructure_projects provide good_value for money, are safe and effective, and that investment expenditures are not diverted inappropriately. Creating a level playing field in procurement ensures that the government receives strong proposals bids of high_quality and that it can award the contract to the most advantageous bidder. To this end, the government has to ensure that procurement_documents are of high_quality, set competitive_bidding conditions, use transparent evaluation_criteria that are fit for purpose, implement integrated e_procurement solutions, and efficiently manage the contract. Competitive_bidding requires the convergence of several criteria, such as a good level of technical depth in the requests_for_proposals, enough time to prepare the proposals, rigorous evaluation of proposals, pre_disclosed contract_conditions and risks, etc. Bidders need to be treated equally and fairly, the rules of the game need to be clear and adhered to, and the process needs to be conducted transparently. E_procurement systems should be implemented to promote efficiency, integrity, and transparency of infrastructure governance, and to provide an interface with financial_management_systems to enhance commitment controls. The systems have to be clear, straightforward, and user_friendly, and they must cover the core_functions throughout the procurement and contract_management cycle. The procurement dimension is meant to ensure that infrastructure_procurement is managed efficiently and in the interest of the public, taking into consideration costs across the project_life_cycle. High_quality, efficient, competitive, and transparent public procurement_systems enable governments to fulfill their core_functions, such as delivering infrastructure_services to citizens; generate trust in government; and create a favorable business environment. Procurement_systems must ensure that investments attain value_for_money and remain affordable with respect to life_cycle costs, taking into account the total_cost over its life_cycle compared to the value of the asset and its economic, environmental, and social_benefits . Although procurement_systems differ across countries, the need for sound regulation and good practices in public_procurement is universal. The framework assesses procurement effectiveness based on the quality of procurement_documents, clear and robust contract settings and monitoring practices, promotion of competition, and implementation of innovative practices, such as e_procurement, that reduce the costs and risks associated with procurement. The assessment looks at all of the above aspects of procurement, in the case of Public Investment Management_systems, and for or similar arrangements, which in certain countries have a separate framework. Principles for Quality Infrastructure Investment, Principle Raising economic_efficiency in View Life_Cycle Cost, p. The legal and regulatory_framework of infrastructure_procurement should be clear, hierarchical, coherent, and non_discriminatory. The legal_framework should ensure that there is a clear linkage between budget_planning and formulation and preparation of the annual procurement_plans . It is also important that stakeholders have access to all the documents and regulations governing procurement in infrastructure. Changes to the relevant legal and regulatory_framework should be discussed with relevant stakeholders and clearly disseminated on the governments\u2019 web portals. The legal and regulatory_framework should be effectively enforced. The government is responsible for ensuring that norms and regulations are being followed by procurement_agencies and others. If there are any exceptions to competitive tendering, those should only be applied where justified by legal frameworks and clearly laid out. In order to attract high_quality bids, and ensure high_quality infrastructure_outputs, procurement_documentation should have accurate project_specifications and clearly outlined expected deliverable s and timelines. Potential bidders assess the quality of documentation not only to ensure that the bidding is competitive, but also because poor information can result in wasted resources and later lead to claims. If the contractors have enough information, they develop a more precise budget and project_specifications. On the other hand, the government can only hold bidders accountable if the deliverable s and timelines are clearly defined and when they have a clear understanding of a project\u2019s progress. Tender_documents therefore play a crucial role in the success of a tender, as well as in the quality of the project overall. They typically comprise of bill of quantities schedule of rates , drawings, instructions to tenderers, specifications, form of contract, conditions of contract, and a list of required documents. \u201cQuality of documentation\u201d means that the information provided is clear and consistent; and that there is sufficient detail to allow companies to respond to requirements and submit responsive bids, develop an adequate design, and understand the price ranges. In order to attract private companies, the procurement_procedure should be, clear, fair, simple, and accountable. Moreover, tendering specifications should be neutral and provide detailed guidance on the expected outputs so as to stimulate high_quality proposals. Efficient practices should be maintained throughout the public_procurement life_cycle to ensure that the rules of the game are clear and unbiased, and that sensible and expedient review and payment procedures are used. The correlation between better procurement_documentation and higher quality_infrastructure_outputs has been studied since the 1970s. For instance, the Coordinating Committee for Project Information published its recommendations on how to improve documentation for construction_projects back in . coordinating Committee for Project Information. Coordinated Project Information for Building Works. Mohammed, H.H., A.H. Ibrahim, and A.E. El_Malt. \u201cAssessment of tender_documents Quality Index.\u201d American Journal of Civil Engineering and Architecture, 1- criteria To hold companies accountable after the contract_award, the procuring_authorities should establish key_performance_indicators and reporting procedures, and set measurable outputs. Contracts should provide information that enables participants to understand the allocation of risk between parties to a contract as well as other obligations that the signatories to the contract will incur. They should set clear timelines and review points that allow the procuring_authority, or an independent_review_body, to assess the deliverable s and formulate opinions. In certain cases, procuring_authorities may implement a pay_for-performance approach as part of the contractual terms. This allows them to better align the incentives of companies with the public_interest. While increasing transparency during the project_planning_process, governments should preserve the flexibility to control key planning levers such as user fees, service coordination, and facility expansion. Contracts should be subject to independent and unbiased selective internal and external_audit to ensure oversight and provide a platform for further improving procurement_practices. Contract_conditions should also cover some practical aspects of contract implementation\u2014e.g., general conditions on inspection, quality_control and final acceptance of products, and procedures relating to invoicing and payment, as well as provisions on dispute_resolution . To strengthen competitiveness, fair and transparent rules of the game should be ensured, including at the preand post_tender stage. Stimulating competition in public_procurement is critical to ensuring that the project represents value_for_money. However, when suitable returns on investments require a longer time horizon, experience shows that governments may struggle to attract enough private_actors willing to bid for the project, limiting competition. It is the responsibility of the government to carefully assess how to make the offer more attractive and to make every effort to ensure that, despite the risks associated with the project and or lower rates of return, the private_sector is willing to participate. Apart from the monetary award, signaling the transparency and openness of procurement_practices can assist in attracting serious private_actors. This requires, first, that information about tenders and their procedures is available openly and freely, that companies are able to participate in tenders without considerable barriers, and that the companies receive fair_treatment. Second, the government should set out clear evaluation_criteria and weightings attached to price and quality, and it should ensure the integrity and fairness of the process. If there is any regulation providing preferential treatment to domestic companies, it should not be to the detriment of competition and integrity, and the regulation should be pre_disclosed. Local content criteria should be used purposefully and with the public_interest foremost, and such criteria should not create a long_term imbalance that undermines the market. Additional instruments can assist with ensuring competitive conditions. Those can include allowing companies to ask questions directly from the procuring_authority in an open forum, making information about contract_awards and contracts publicly available, and setting up an unbiased complaint review process. criterion Siemiatycki, M., and N.

It can be difficult to oversee the performance of infrastructure_service_delivery and thereby maintain value_for_money throughout the performance of the asset. In order to deal with change, Ireland has developed guidelines to tackle adverse_development or changes in the circumstances surrounding an infrastructure_project. It requires the sponsoring agency to report regularly on significant_developments impacting the project_cost. If deviations are such that corrective_measures are not enough and incurred cost may go over the originally approved envelope, the approval of a different_sanctioning_authority is necessary before any cost_increases are accepted. The viability of the project should be reassessed based on the changed circumstances and a decision to terminate it before completion could be taken if the gravity of the circumstances so requires. Source: World Bank Public Investment Management Reference Guide Asset_registers should be maintained, and asset_values recorded\u2014and, more importantly, enough resources should be devoted to the maintenance and rehabilitation of existing assets. Besides proper_contract_management for the construction_acquisition of assets it is also important to properly manage the infrastructure_assets in delivery of services. Ideally, countries should require their operating units to compile balance_sheets, on which the value of assets created through new fixed capital_expenditures would be recorded. Whether there is accrual_accounting or not, agencies should maintain asset_registers that are exhaustive in their recordkeeping, and where necessary, legal_title to property is affixed.

The government\nneeds to invest in collecting, monitoring, and analyzing high-quality and integrated data\nthat can serve as the basis for project management, decision-making, consultation, and\naccountability. The degree to which the data are made public should be determined by a\ndisclosure framework that weighs the trade-offs of transparency and confidentiality. The\nframework should be enforced, and relevant public institutions scrutinized on their per-\nformance in complying with transparency requirements. Disclosed data should be easy to\naccess, navigate, and analyze.\nThe availability of adequate information and data is essential to ensure that a project\ndelivers. Good data support sound decision-making and ensure government and private\nimplementors are held to account for their performance. If done right, transparency en-\nhances performance and learning, and it prevents misconduct. Civil society organizations\ncan play an important role in monitoring performance standards if data are available.23\nTransparent data also enhance the investment climate by assuring domestic and foreign\ninvestors that they will operate in a predictable and regulation-based context.\nProject and service delivery data should be comprehensive, high quality, and integrat-\ned. Governments should invest in the necessary IT infrastructure and tools to collect\nhigh-quality data throughout the project cycle. Where possible, data collection should be\nautomated and real-time\u2014or regular, at the very least. Ideally, project and service delivery\ndata should be centralized in a single platform from all contracting authorities to provide a\npicture of the entire investment portfolio, regardless of sector or financing modality. Data\ncollection and monitoring should be synchronized across the different IT systems (such as\nbudgeting, procurement, etc.).\nEnhancing the capacity to collect, monitor, and analyze project and service delivery data\nwill increase impact. Beyond investments in IT systems, relevant public institutions need the\ntechnical capacity to collect, manage, and analyze data in order to make the best use of\nit. This serves as the basis for evidence-based management and decision-making at the\nproject, sector, and central government levels.\n23 Construction Sector Transparency Initiative; GIFT High Level Principle 1; the OECD Budget Transpar-\nency Toolkit; and the World Bank Policy on Access to Information.\n\nTo determine in a systematic way how much of the information and data should be pub-\nlished and when, governments should design and enforce a disclosure framework.24 Trans-\nparency requirements are diverse, given the scale, complexity, and long duration of infra-\nstructure projects, their one-off nature, and the different types of entities involved. As\nsuch, the disclosure framework should be designed based on the objectives and drivers of\ndisclosure, and its challenges and benefits. The framework should focus on users and uses\nof the disclosed information, the type of government support, and, especially, government\nfiscal risk and exposure. The framework should preferably provide a mandate for proactive\ndisclosure, and should be harmonized with existing legislation on transparency, such as\nrelevant provisions in the Freedom of Information (FOI), PIM, PPP, public financial manage-\nment (PFM), budget transparency, or other legislation. In addition, the framework should\nalso provide sufficient guidance to officials for implementation. The implementing agencies\nand relevant central institutions should be responsible and accountable for ensuring the\ntransparency of the project and service delivery. They should be scrutinized on their perfor-\nmance on this both by the SAI and by civil society.\nThe data and information disclosed across the project cycle should be easy to access,\nnavigate, and analyze. The framework should allow for the regular and timely disclosure\nof information throughout the key stages of an infrastructure project cycle (identifica-\ntion, preparation, procurement, and implementation\u2014with the latter including performance\nindicators). Transparency and disclosure clauses should also be part of any contracts. It\nis also important that the annual budget documents contain information on infrastructure\nspending and commitments, given their size and long-term fiscal and other impacts. All\nthis information should be published online by the implementing agencies and\/or centrally\nthrough an integrated platform. Whereas automatically synchronized real-time information\nwould be ideal, less advanced disclosure mechanisms can also suffice, as long as the in-\nformation is regularly updated and easy to navigate (e.g., publish financial data in an Excel\nsheet instead of a pdf).\n24 For more on the World Bank guidance on the disclosure framework for PPPs, with relevance to infra-\nstructure in general, see: World Bank, Framework for Disclosure in Public-Private Partnership Proj-\nects, 2016 http:\/\/pubdocs.worldbank.org\/en\/773541448296707678\/Disclosure-in-PPPs-Framework.pdf\n\nTABLE 9\nKey Questions and Indicators for Dimension 8\nKEY QUESTIONS*\n(cid:0) Does the government collect, monitor, and analyze project and service delivery data\nthroughout the project cycle?\n(cid:0) Do existing regulations outline clear and comprehensive transparency requirements for infra-\nstructure projects?\n(cid:0) Do relevant public institutions have the technical capacity to collect, monitor, and analyze\nproject and service delivery data?\n(cid:0) Are project and service delivery information data disclosed throughout the project cycle?\n(cid:0) Are disclosed information and data easy to access, navigate, and analyze?\nKEY INDICATORS^\n(cid:0) Benchmarking Infrastructure Development TPI Survey (available for 40 economies;\nsource: World Bank)\n(cid:0) Question 13.1 on publication of the assessment\n(cid:0) Question 14 on publication of the tender documents\n(cid:0) Question 19 on publication of the tender notice\n(cid:0) Question 36 on publication of the award notice\n(cid:0) Question 42 on publication of the contract\n(cid:0) Question 45 on publication of construction progress information\n(cid:0) Benchmarking Infrastructure Development PPP Survey (available for 140 economies;\nsource: World Bank)\n(cid:0) Question 11.1 on publication of the assessment\n(cid:0) Question 12 on publication of the tender documents\n(cid:0) Question 17 on publication of the tender notice\n(cid:0) Question 28 on publication of the award notice\n(cid:0) Question 33 on publication of the contract\n(cid:0) Question 36 on publication of construction progress information\n(cid:0) Question 37 on publication of operation\/performance information\n(cid:0) Open Budget Index (available for 117 countries)\n(cid:0) Methodology for Assessing Procurement Systems (MAPS) (available for seven countries):\nselected questions on the transparency and data use of procurement\n(cid:0) Pillar II.

To minimize\nand manage these integrity risks, governments should consider instituting a regulatory\nframework that covers both the prevention and prosecution of misconduct. Mechanisms to\nprotect and promote integrity should be incorporated across the investment cycle; special\nmeasures to target behaviors in both public and private sectors can play a positive role;\nand independent and well-resourced monitoring and prosecution services are important.\nThe experiences of successful countries show it is helpful to go beyond individual safe-\nguards and develop a comprehensive, whole-of-government approach to guard the integri-\nty of infrastructure projects. The importance of integrity in infrastructure is hard to over-\nestimate, given that these projects are typically characterized by political sensitivity, large\nbudgets, long duration, and the significant complexity of contractual relations (especially\nin the case of PPPs).\nIntegrity risks are present throughout the project cycle (see Figure 2, below). The most\ncommon of these threats are related to the tender process for construction, mainly in the\nform of bribes paid to obtain the contract. While such practices have been widespread\nfor a long time, corruption methods are becoming increasingly sophisticated\u2014for example,\nthree out of four foreign bribery cases involve intermediaries, such as local subcontractors,\nconsultants, agents, or corporate vehicles (including subsidiary companies, local consulting\nfirms, offshore companies in tax havens, etc.).25 Furthermore, beyond bribery, there are oth-\ner ways of compromising the integrity of infrastructure project procurement, most notably\nkickbacks, collusion, and bid rigging. However, apart from the most vulnerable stage\u2014pro-\ncurement\u2014there are integrity risks at every stage of the cycle, as illustrated below. More-\nover, corruption during the early stages of project appraisal, design, and budgeting may\nopen doors for wrongdoing later. Most countries have implemented mechanisms to reduce\nsome of the more obvious entry points for corruption, such as by improving transparen-\ncy and competitiveness during the main tender process. However, by only targeting some\ntypes of risk, corruption may simply shift to other stages. For instance, if the contract\naward is difficult to influence, corrupt activity may center on the project design and ap-\npraisal phase, or through addendums to the contract during project implementation.\n25 OECD (2014).

Examples of Corruption in Infrastructure, Global Infrastructure Anti-Corruption Centre\n\nIn order to minimize and manage these integrity risks, successful governments develop and\nenforce a regulatory framework that covers both the prevention and prosecution aspects\nof misconduct. There may be a trans-governmental regulatory and policy framework out-\nlining integrity standards and mechanisms. At the same time, integrity issues can be also\nintegrated into the specific regulatory framework on PIM, PPPs, SOEs, as well as sectoral\nlegislation. On the enforcement side, effective mechanisms to uncover, investigate, and\nprosecute misconduct should be put in place. Experience shows that successful reform in\nthis area requires high-level political will, managerial commitment, and sufficient capacity in\npublic institutions.\nMechanisms to protect and promote integrity should be incorporated across the invest-\nment cycle. Corruption risk prevention and mitigation should be conducted along the\nparameters of (i) identifying high(er)-risk stakeholders and actors; and (ii) focusing on the\nproject phases that have higher corruption risks. During project preparation, prioritization,\nand selection, potential projects must be objectively assessed, costed, present good value\nfor money, be in the public interest, and be delivered and financed in the most efficient\nmodalities. During the procurement stage, due diligence on bidders, competitiveness of\ntender (including for USPs), and meeting transparency requirements are necessary. A for-\nmal integrity policy should be in place requiring that due diligence be undertaken to verify\nthe representations made by bidders in terms of their financial and technical capacity; and\nto ascertain whether the bidders or any of their principals have engaged in any miscon-\nduct, are the subject of ongoing or past investigations, or are associated with organized\ncrime, blacklisted, or designated as tax delinquent. Integrity clauses should also be built\ninto contracts. To protect integrity at the stage of the post-tender\/implementation phase,\nthe monitoring and evaluation of project performance needs to remain unbiased, and any\npotential contract renegotiations need to be transparent.27\nAs additional prevention, governments and companies should foster a culture of integrity\nand awareness of fraud and corruption risks to further enhance results. Clear commit-\nments by the implementing unit to a zero-tolerance approach towards misconduct is valu-\nable. Governments could require asset and conflict-of-interest declarations from public\nofficials involved in infrastructure projects and have an anti-bribery framework in place. On\nthe private side, companies could publicly disclose all political contributions (unless secrecy\nor confidentiality is legally required). Both governments and companies could institute and\ntrain staff in a code of conduct. Companies should conduct an integrity risk assessment\nand draw up a risk mitigation plan, focusing on country, industry, client, transaction, busi-\nness partnership, process, and internal risks (for example, pay structure and gift policy).\nTop management should commit to act on identified integrity risks. Companies should also\nconduct integrity due diligence on current and future employees with any decision-making\nauthority, and on agents and business partners, to ensure they are reputable and\nthat their role is appropriate and commensurate with their remuneration. Both public\ninstitutions and companies should have in place functioning complaint and whistle-blower\nprotection mechanisms.\n27 Jill Wells (2015). Corruption in the construction of public infrastructure: Critical issues in project\npreparation, Anti-corruption Resource Centre, U4 Issue Nr. 8; Catherine Stansbury, Neill Stansbury\n(2008). Examples of Corruption in Infrastructure, Global Infrastructure Anti-Corruption Centre\n\nFinally, a functioning and unbiased prosecution of breaches of integrity is necessary.\nMechanisms need to be in place to audit, investigate, prosecute, and sanction any type of\nmisconduct. There should be mechanisms for challenging procurement decisions for integ-\nrity-related violations, as well as to ensure that the uncovered irregularities are prosecuted\nand sanctioned, and that justice is effectively enforced.

There is a need for systematic measures in place to foster integrity and manage the risk of misconduct along the project cycle. Integrity risks are present at every stage of the project cycle given the complex nature, substantial cost, and political significance of most infrastructure projects. To minimize and manage these integrity risks, governments should consider instituting a regulatory framework that covers both the prevention and prosecution of misconduct. Mechanisms to protect and promote integrity should be incorporated across the investment cycle; special measures to target behaviors in both public and private sectors can play a positive role; and independent and well-resourced monitoring and prosecution services are important. The experiences of successful countries show it is helpful to go beyond individual safeguards and develop a comprehensive, whole-of-government approach to guard the integrity of infrastructure projects. The importance of integrity in infrastructure is hard to overestimate, given that these projects are typically characterized by political sensitivity, large budgets, long duration, and the significant complexity of contractual relations . Integrity risks are present throughout the project cycle . The most common of these threats are related to the tender process for construction, mainly in the form of bribes paid to obtain the contract. While such practices have been widespread for a long time, corruption methods are becoming increasingly sophisticated\u2014for example, three out of four foreign bribery cases involve intermediaries, such as local subcontractors, consultants, agents, or corporate vehicles . Furthermore, beyond bribery, there are other ways of compromising the integrity of infrastructure project procurement, most notably kickbacks, collusion, and bid rigging. However, apart from the most vulnerable stage\u2014procurement\u2014there are integrity risks at every stage of the cycle, as illustrated below. Moreover, corruption during the early stages of project appraisal, design, and budgeting may open doors for wrongdoing later. Most countries have implemented mechanisms to reduce some of the more obvious entry points for corruption, such as by improving transparency and competitiveness during the main tender process. However, by only targeting some types of risk, corruption may simply shift to other stages. For instance, if the contract award is difficult to influence, corrupt activity may center on the project design and appraisal phase, or through addendums to the contract during project implementation. .

There may be a trans-governmental regulatory and policy framework outlining integrity standards and mechanisms. At the same time, integrity issues can be also integrated into the specific regulatory framework on , , , as well as sectoral legislation. On the enforcement side, effective mechanisms to uncover, investigate, and prosecute misconduct should be put in place. Experience shows that successful reform in this area requires high-level political will, managerial commitment, and sufficient capacity in public institutions. Mechanisms to protect and promote integrity should be incorporated across the investment cycle. Corruption risk prevention and mitigation should be conducted along the parameters of identifying high-risk stakeholders and actors; and focusing on the project phases that have higher corruption risks. During project preparation, prioritization, and selection, potential projects must be objectively assessed, costed, present good value for money, be in the public interest, and be delivered and financed in the most efficient modalities. During the procurement stage, due diligence on bidders, competitiveness of tender , and meeting transparency requirements are necessary. a formal integrity policy should be in place requiring that due diligence be undertaken to verify the representations made by bidders in terms of their financial and technical capacity; and to ascertain whether the bidders or any of their principals have engaged in any misconduct, are the subject of ongoing or past investigations, or are associated with organized crime, blacklisted, or designated as tax delinquent. Integrity clauses should also be built into contracts. To protect integrity at the stage of the post-tender implementation phase, the monitoring and evaluation of project performance needs to remain unbiased, and any potential contract renegotiations need to be transparent. As additional prevention, governments and companies should foster a culture of integrity and awareness of fraud and corruption risks to further enhance results. Clear commitments by the implementing unit to a zero-tolerance approach towards misconduct is valuable. Governments could require asset and conflict-of-interest declarations from public officials involved in infrastructure projects and have an anti-bribery framework in place. On the private side, companies could publicly disclose all political contributions . Both governments and companies could institute and train staff in a code of conduct. Companies should conduct an integrity risk assessment and draw up a risk mitigation plan, focusing on country, industry, client, transaction, business partnership, process, and internal risks . Top management should commit to act on identified integrity risks. Companies should also conduct integrity due diligence on current and future employees with any decision-making authority, and on agents and business partners, to ensure they are reputable and that their role is appropriate and commensurate with their remuneration. Both public institutions and companies should have in place functioning complaint and whistle-blower protection mechanisms. Jill Wells .

The availability of adequate_information and data on projects and service_delivery is essential for ensuring accountability, improving project_performance, strengthening the investment_climate, and maintaining public confidence in the private_sector. The government needs to invest in collecting, monitoring, and analyzing high_quality and integrated data that can serve as the basis for project_management, decision_making, consultation, and accountability. The degree to which the data are made public should be determined by a disclosure_framework that weighs the trade_offs of transparency and confidentiality. The framework should be enforced, and relevant_public_institutions scrutinized on their performance in complying with transparency_requirements. Disclosed data should be easy to access, navigate, and analyze. The availability of adequate_information and data is essential to ensure that a project delivers. Good data support sound decision_making and ensure government and private implementors are held to account for their performance. If done right, transparency enhances performance and learning, and it prevents misconduct. Civil_society organizations can play an important_role in monitoring performance_standards if data are available. Transparent_data also enhance the investment_climate by assuring domestic and foreign investors that they will operate in a predictable and regulation_based context. Project and service_delivery_data should be comprehensive, high_quality, and integrated. Governments should invest in the necessary infrastructure and tools to collect high_quality data throughout the project_cycle. Where possible, data_collection should be automated and real_time\u2014or regular, at the very least. Ideally, project and service_delivery_data should be centralized in a single platform from all contracting authorities to provide a picture of the entire investment portfolio, regardless of sector or financing modality. Data_collection and monitoring should be synchronized across the different systems . Enhancing the capacity to collect, monitor, and analyze project and service_delivery_data will increase impact. Beyond investments in systems, relevant_public_institutions need the technical_capacity to collect, manage, and analyze data in order to make the best use of it.

Construction Sector Transparency Initiative; High Level Principle 1; the budget_transparency Toolkit; and the World Bank Policy on access_to_information. To determine in a systematic way how much of the information and data should be published and when, governments should design and enforce a disclosure_framework. Transparency_requirements are diverse, given the scale, complexity, and long_duration of infrastructure_projects, their one_off nature, and the different_types of entities involved. As such, the disclosure_framework should be designed based on the objectives and drivers of disclosure, and its challenges and benefits. The framework should focus on users and uses of the disclosed_information, the type of government_support, and, especially, government fiscal risk and exposure. The framework should preferably provide a mandate for proactive disclosure, and should be harmonized with existing legislation on transparency, such as relevant_provisions in the Freedom of Information , , , public_financial_management , budget_transparency, or other legislation. In addition, the framework should also provide sufficient guidance to officials for implementation.

Measures will be put\nin place to make the grievance mechanism easily\naccessible to all such project workers.\n22. The grievance mechanism will be proportionate\nto the nature and scale and the potential risks and\nimpacts of the project. It will be designed to address\nconcerns promptly, using an understandable and\ntransparent process that provides timely feedback\nto those concerned in a language they understand,\nwithout any retribution, and will operate in an\nindependent and objective manner. The grievance\nmechanism may utilize existing grievance mecha-\nnisms, providing that they are properly designed\nand implemented, address concerns promptly, and\nare readily accessible to such project workers.

The Borrower will design, construct, operate,\nand decommission the structural elements of the\nproject in accordance with national legal require-\nments, the EHSGs and other GIIP, taking into con-\nsideration safety risks to third parties and affected\ncommunities. Structural elements of a project will\nbe designed and constructed by competent profes-\nsionals, and certified or approved by competent\nauthorities or professionals.1 Structural design will\ntake into account climate change considerations, as\nappropriate.\n7. Where the project includes new buildings and\nstructures that will be accessed by members of\nthe public, the Borrower will consider the incre-\nmental risks of the public\u2019s potential exposure to\noperational accidents or natural hazards, includ-\ning extreme weather events. Where technically and\nfinancially feasible, the Borrower will also apply the\nconcept of universal access2 to the design and con-\nstruction of such new buildings and structures.\n8. When structural elements or components of a\nproject are situated in high-risk locations, includ-\ning those with risk of extreme weather or slow\nonset events, and their failure or malfunction may\nthreaten the safety of communities, the Borrower\nwill engage one or more independent experts with\nrelevant and recognized experience in similar proj-\nects, separate from those responsible for the design\nand construction, to conduct a review as early as\npossible in project development and throughout the\nstages of project design, construction, operation,\nand decommissioning. Where the project involves a\nnew or existing dam, the Borrower will provide suffi-\ncient resources to apply the requirements on safety\nof dams, as set out in Annex 1.\n1 This may include, where appropriate, third-party life and fire\nsafety audits for existing buildings that are used for communal\npurposes and for new buildings prior to their commissioning or\nuse.\n2T he concept of universal access means unimpeded access for\npeople of all ages and abilities in different situations and under\nvarious circumstances, as set out in GIIP.\n46\n1707130_Environmental_and_Social_Framework.indd 46\n\nof services\nWhere the project involves provision of services\ncommunities, the Borrower will establish and\nappropriate quality management sys-\nto anticipate and minimize risks and impacts\nsuch services may have on community health\nsafety.

The Borrower will avoid or minimize the poten-\ntial for community exposure to water-borne, water-\nbased, water-related, and vector-borne diseases,\nand communicable and noncommunicable diseases\nthat could result from project activities, taking into\nconsideration differentiated exposure to and higher\nsensitivity of vulnerable groups. Where specific dis-\neases5 are endemic in communities in the project\narea, the Borrower is encouraged to explore oppor-\ntunities during the project life cycle to improve\nenvironmental conditions that could help minimize\ntheir incidence.\n16. The Borrower will take measures to avoid or\nminimize transmission of communicable diseases\nthat may be associated with the influx of temporary\nor permanent project labor.\nManagement and safety of hazardous materials\n17. The Borrower will avoid or minimize the poten-\ntial for community exposure to hazardous materials\nand substances that may be released by the project.\nWhere there is a potential for the public (including\nworkers and their families) to be exposed to haz-\nards, particularly those that may be life threaten-\ning, the Borrower will exercise special care to avoid\nor minimize their exposure by modifying, substitut-\ning, or eliminating the condition or material causing\nthe potential hazards. Where hazardous materials\nare part of existing project infrastructure or com-\nponents, the Borrower will exercise due care dur-\ning construction and implementation of the project,\nincluding decommissioning, to avoid exposure to\nthe community.\n18. The Borrower will implement measures and\nactions to control the safety of deliveries of hazard-\nous materials, and of storage, transportation and\ndisposal of hazardous materials and wastes, and\n4F or example, land use changes or the loss of natural buffer\nareas, such as wetlands, mangroves and upland forests, which\nmitigate the effects of natural hazards such as flooding, land-\nslides and fire, may result in increased vulnerability and com-\nmunity safety-related risks and impacts.

The Borrower will review the ERP on a regular\nbasis, and confirm that it is still capable of address-\ning the potential range of emergency events that\nmight arise in connection with the project. The Bor-\nrower will support affected communities, relevant\ngovernment agencies and other relevant parties\nthrough training and collaboration, and will conduct\nsuch training in conjunction with the training pro-\nvided to project workers as part of the OHS require-\nments under ESS2.\nB. Security personnel\n24. When the Borrower retains direct or contracted\nworkers to provide security to safeguard its person-\nnel and property, it will assess risks posed by these\nsecurity arrangements to those within and outside\nthe project site. In making such arrangements, the\nBorrower will be guided by the principles of propor-\ntionality and GIIP, and by applicable law, in relation\nto hiring, rules of conduct, training, equipping, and\nmonitoring of such security workers. The Borrower\nwill not sanction any use of force by direct or con-\ntracted workers in providing security except when\nused for preventive and defensive purposes in pro-\nportion to the nature and extent of the threat.\n25. The Borrower will seek to ensure that gov-\nernment security personnel deployed to provide\nsecurity services act in a manner consistent with\nparagraph 24 above, and encourage the relevant\nauthorities to disclose the security arrangements\nfor the Borrower\u2019s facilities to the public, subject to\noverriding security concerns.\n26. The Borrower will (i) make reasonable inqui-\nries to verify that the direct or contracted workers\nretained by the Borrower to provide security are not\nimplicated in past abuses; (ii) train them adequately\n(or determine that they are properly trained) in the\nuse of force (and where applicable, firearms), and\nappropriate conduct toward workers and affected\ncommunities; and (iii) require them to act within the\napplicable law and any requirements set out in the\nESCP.\n27. The Borrower will review all allegations of unlaw-\nful or abusive acts of security personnel, take action\n(or urge appropriate parties to take action) to pre-\nvent recurrence and, where necessary, report unlaw-\nful and abusive acts to the relevant authorities.\n48\n1707130_Environmental_and_Social_Framework.indd 48\n\n1. Safety of dams\nnew dams\nThe Borrower will engage experienced and com-\nprofessionals for the supervision of the\nand construction of new dams,7 and require\nowner of the dam to adopt and implement dam\nmeasures during the design, bid tendering,\noperation, and maintenance of the\nand associated works.\nThe dam safety requirements set out in this\napply to:\n\u201cLarge dams\u201d which are defined as dams with a\nheight of 15 meters or greater from the lowest\nfoundation to crest or dams between 5 meters\nand 15 meters impounding more than 3 million\ncubic meters;\nAll other dams regardless of size or retention\ncapacity (referred to as \u201csmall dams\u201d) that\n(cid:1010)i(cid:1011)(cid:1053)could cause safety risks, such as an unusu-\nally large flood-handling requirement, location\nin a zone of high seismicity, foundations that\nare complex and difficult to prepare, retention\nof toxic materials, or potential for significant\ndownstream impacts or (ii) are expected to\nbecome large dams during their operating life.\nThe dams referred to in paragraph 2 require:\nReviews by an independent panel of experts\n(the Panel) of the investigation, design, and\nconstruction of the dam and the start of\noperations;\nPreparation and implementation of the fol-\nlowing detailed plans, as further described in\nSection C:8 a plan for construction supervi-\nsion and quality assurance, an instrumentation\nplan, an operation and maintenance plan, and\nan emergency preparedness plan;\nPrequalification of bidders during procurement\nand bid tendering; and\nams include, for example, a water storage dam for a hydro-\nwater supply, irrigation, flood control, or multipurpose\na tailings or a slimes dam, or an ash impoundment dam.\nAs part of established dam safety practices in certain coun-\nthe Operation and Maintenance (O&M) Plan includes the\nPlan and the Emergency Preparedness Plan as\nsections of the O&M Plan.

The risks associated with a dam are design\nand situation specific, and will vary depending on\nstructural components, socioeconomic factors and\nthe environment within which the dam is being\nconstructed and will operate. Application of the\nrequirements set out in paragraph 3 will reflect\nthese considerations, and be proportionate to the\nsize, complexity and potential risk of the dam.\n5. Where a dam does not fall into the categories set\nout in paragraph 2, dam safety measures designed\nby qualified engineers in accordance with GIIP will\nbe adopted and implemented.9\n6. The Panel referred to in paragraph 3 above con-\nsists of three or more experts, appointed by the\nBorrower and acceptable to the Bank, with exper-\ntise in the various technical fields relevant to the\nsafety aspects of the particular dam.10 The Panel\nwill review and advise the Borrower on matters\nrelative to dam safety and other critical aspects of\nthe dam, its appurtenant structures, the catchment\narea, the area surrounding the reservoir, and down-\nstream areas. The Borrower will normally extend the\nPanel\u2019s composition and terms of reference beyond\ndam safety, to cover such areas as project formula-\ntion; technical design; construction procedures; and,\nfor water storage dams, associated works such as\npower facilities, river diversion during construction,\nship lifts, and fish ladders.\n7. The Borrower will contract the services of the\nPanel and will provide administrative support for its\nactivities. Beginning as early in project preparation\nas possible, the Borrower will arrange for periodic\nPanel meetings and reviews, which will continue\nthrough the investigation, design, construction, and\ninitial filling and start-up phases of the dam.11 The\nBorrower will inform the Bank in advance of the\nPanel meetings.12 After each meeting, the Panel\n9I n such circumstances, the Borrower will confirm, through the\nenvironmental and social assessment, that there will be no or\nnegligible risk of significant adverse impacts due to potential\nfailure of the dam structure to local communities and assets,\nincluding assets to be financed as part of the proposed project.\nSuch dams could include farm ponds, local silt retention dams\nand low embankment tanks.\n10T he number, professional breadth, technical expertise, and\nexperience of Panel members are appropriate to the size, com-\nplexity, and hazard potential of the dam under consideration. For\nhigh-hazard dams, in particular, the Panel members will possess\nrecognized international expertise in their field.\n11I f the Bank\u2019s involvement begins at a later stage than project\npreparation, the Panel is constituted as soon as possible and\nreviews any aspects of the project that have already been car-\nried out.\n12T he Bank will normally send an observer to these meetings.\n1707130_Environmental_and_Social_Framework.indd 49\n\nprovide the Borrower with a written report of\nconclusions and recommendations, signed by\nparticipating member; the Borrower will pro-\na copy of the Panel\u2019s report to the Bank.

This addresses potential risks and impacts communities that may be affected by project Occupational health and safety for project workers are set out in and measures to avoid or minimize impacts on health and the environment due to existing potential pollution are set out in . requirements a. community health and safety The Borrower will evaluate the risks and impacts of the project on the health and safety of the affected communities during the project life cycle, including those who, because of their particular circumstances, may be vulnerable. The Borrower will identify risks and impacts and propose mitigation measures in accordance with the mitigation hierarchy. Infrastructure and equipment design and safety The Borrower will design, construct, operate, and decommission the structural elements of the project in accordance with national legal requirements, the and other , taking into consideration safety risks to third parties and affected communities. Structural elements of a project will be designed and constructed by competent professionals, and certified or approved by competent authorities or professionals. Structural design will take into account climate change considerations, as appropriate. Where the project includes new buildings and structures that will be accessed by members of the public, the Borrower will consider the incremental risks of the public\u2019s potential exposure to operational accidents or natural hazards, including extreme weather events. Where technically and financially feasible, the Borrower will also apply the concept of universal access to the design and construction of such new buildings and structures. When structural elements or components of a project are situated in high-risk locations, including those with risk of extreme weather or slow onset events, and their failure or malfunction may threaten the safety of communities, the Borrower will engage one or more independent experts with relevant and recognized experience in similar projects, separate from those responsible for the design and construction, to conduct a review as early as possible in project development and throughout the stages of project design, construction, operation, and decommissioning. Where the project involves a new or existing dam, the Borrower will provide sufficient resources to apply the requirements on safety of dams, as set out in Annex This may include, where appropriate, third-party life and fire safety audits for existing buildings that are used for communal purposes and for new buildings prior to their commissioning or use. The concept of universal access means unimpeded access for people of all ages and abilities in different situations and under various circumstances, as set out in . of services Where the project involves provision of services communities, the Borrower will establish and appropriate quality management systo anticipate and minimize risks and impacts such services may have on community health safety. In such circumstances, the Borrower will apply the concept of universal access, where and financially feasible. and road safety The Borrower will identify, evaluate and monitor potential traffic and road safety risks to work affected communities and road users throughthe project life cycle and, where appropriate, develop measures and plans to address them. Borrower will incorporate technically and finanfeasible road safety measures into the project to prevent and mitigate potential road safety to road users and affected communities. Where appropriate, the Borrower will undertake road safety assessment for each phase of the and will monitor incidents and accidents, prepare regular reports of such monitoring. The will use the reports to identify negative issues, and establish and implement meato resolve them. For vehicles or fleets of vehicles for the purposes the project , the Borrower will in place appropriate processes, including driver to improve driver and vehicle safety, as as systems for monitoring and enforcement. Borrower will consider the safety record or ratof vehicles in purchase or leasing decisions and regular maintenance of all project vehicles. For projects that operate construction and other on public roads or where the use of equipment could have an impact on public or other public infrastructure, the Borrower take appropriate safety measures to avoid the of incidents and injuries to members the public associated with the operation of such services The project\u2019s direct impacts on ecosystem sermay result in adverse health and safety risks May include all motorized transportation relevant to the project. to and impacts on affected communities. With respect to this , ecosystem services are limited to provisioning and regulating services as defined in . Where appropriate and feasible, the Borrower will identify the project\u2019s potential risks and impacts on ecosystem services that may be exacerbated by climate change. Adverse impacts will be avoided, and if they are unavoidable, the Borrower will implement appropriate mitigation measures. Community exposure to health issues The Borrower will avoid or minimize the potential for community exposure to water-borne, waterbased, water-related, and vector-borne diseases, and communicable and noncommunicable diseases that could result from project activities, taking into consideration differentiated exposure to and higher sensitivity of vulnerable groups. Where specific diseases are endemic in communities in the project area, the Borrower is encouraged to explore opportunities during the project life cycle to improve environmental conditions that could help minimize their incidence. The Borrower will take measures to avoid or minimize transmission of communicable diseases that may be associated with the influx of temporary or permanent project labor. Management and safety of hazardous materials The Borrower will avoid or minimize the potential for community exposure to hazardous materials and substances that may be released by the project. Where there is a potential for the public to be exposed to hazards, particularly those that may be life threatening, the Borrower will exercise special care to avoid or minimize their exposure by modifying, substituting, or eliminating the condition or material causing the potential hazards. Where hazardous materials are part of existing project infrastructure or components, the Borrower will exercise due care during construction and implementation of the project, including decommissioning, to avoid exposure to the community. The Borrower will implement measures and actions to control the safety of deliveries of hazardous materials, and of storage, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes, and For example, land use changes or the loss of natural buffer areas, such as wetlands, mangroves and upland forests, which mitigate the effects of natural hazards such as flooding, landslides and fire, may result in increased vulnerability and community safety-related risks and impacts.

The dams referred to in paragraph require: Reviews by an independent panel of experts of the investigation, design, and construction of the dam and the start of operations; Preparation and implementation of the following detailed plans, as further described in Section C: a plan for construction supervision and quality assurance, an instrumentation plan, an operation and maintenance plan, and an emergency preparedness plan; Prequalification of bidders during procurement and bid tendering; and ams include, for example, a water storage dam for a hydro water supply, irrigation, flood control, or multipurpose a tailings or a slimes dam, or an ash impoundment dam. As part of established dam safety practices in certain counthe Operation and Maintenance Plan includes the Plan and the Emergency Preparedness Plan as sections of the O&M Plan. This method will be accept provided the relevant sections of the O&M Plan contain the and are prepared in accordance with the timing, set out Section Cbelow. Periodic safety inspections of the dam after completion, and implementation of measures required to address safety deficiencies. The risks associated with a dam are design and situation specific, and will vary depending on structural components, socioeconomic factors and the environment within which the dam is being constructed and will operate. Application of the requirements set out in paragraph will reflect these considerations, and be proportionate to the size, complexity and potential risk of the dam. Where a dam does not fall into the categories set out in paragraph 2, dam safety measures designed by qualified engineers in accordance with will be adopted and implemented. The Panel referred to in paragraph above consists of three or more experts, appointed by the Borrower and acceptable to the Bank, with expertise in the various technical fields relevant to the safety aspects of the particular dam. The Panel will review and advise the Borrower on matters relative to dam safety and other critical aspects of the dam, its appurtenant structures, the catchment area, the area surrounding the reservoir, and downstream areas. The Borrower will normally extend the Panel\u2019s composition and terms of reference beyond dam safety, to cover such areas as project formulation; technical design; construction procedures; and, for water storage dams, associated works such as power facilities, river diversion during construction, ship lifts, and fish ladders. The Borrower will contract the services of the Panel and will provide administrative support for its activities. Beginning as early in project preparation as possible, the Borrower will arrange for periodic Panel meetings and reviews, which will continue through the investigation, design, construction, and initial filling and start-up phases of the dam.

An emergency is an unanticipated incident, arising from both and man_made hazards, typically in the form fire, explosions, leaks or spills, which may occur a variety of different reasons, including failure to operating procedures that are designed prevent their occurrence, extreme_weather or lack early warning. The measures will be designed to the emergency event in a coordinated and manner, to prevent it from injuring the and safety of the community, and to mini mitigate and compensate for any impacts that occur. Borrowers engaged in projects having the to generate emergency_events will conduct risk hazard assessment , as part of the environmental and social_assessment undertaken purto . Based on the results of the , the will prepare an Emergency Response Plan in coordination with the relevant local_authorities and the affected community, and will take into the emergency prevention, preparedness response arrangements put into place with workers under .

The Borrower will document its emergency and response activities, resources, responsibilities, and will disclose appropriate information, as well as any subsequent mate changes thereto, to affected_communities, government_agencies, or other relevant The Borrower will assist and collaborate affected_communities, relevant_government and other relevant_parties in their prepto respond effectively to an emergency , paragraph event, especially where their participation and collaboration will be an important part of an effective response. The Borrower will review the on a regular_basis, and confirm that it is still capable of addressing the potential range of emergency_events that might arise in connection with the project. The Borrower will support affected_communities, relevant_government_agencies and other relevant_parties through training and collaboration, and will conduct such training in conjunction with the training provided to project_workers as part of the requirements under . B. Security_personnel When the Borrower retains direct or contracted workers to provide security to safeguard its personnel and property, it will assess risks posed by these security_arrangements to those within and outside the project_site. In making such arrangements, the Borrower will be guided by the principles of proportionality and , and by applicable_law, in relation to hiring, rules of conduct, training, equipping, and monitoring of such security workers. The Borrower will not sanction any use of force by direct or contracted workers in providing security except when used for preventive and defensive purposes in proportion to the nature and extent of the threat. The Borrower will seek to ensure that government security_personnel deployed to provide security_services act in a manner consistent with paragraph above, and encourage the relevant_authorities to disclose the security_arrangements for the Borrower\u2019s facilities to the public, subject to overriding security concerns. The Borrower will make reasonable inquiries to verify that the direct or contracted workers retained by the Borrower to provide security are not implicated in past abuses; train them adequately in the use of force , and appropriate conduct toward workers and affected_communities; and require them to act within the applicable_law and any requirements set out in the . The Borrower will review all allegations of unlawful or abusive_acts of security_personnel, take action to prevent recurrence and, where necessary, report unlawful and abusive_acts to the relevant_authorities. Safety of dams new_dams The Borrower will engage experienced and comprofessionals for the supervision of the and construction of new_dams, and require owner of the dam to adopt and implement dam measures during the design, bid_tendering, operation, and maintenance of the and associated works. The dam_safety requirements set out in this apply to: \u201cLarge_dams\u201d which are defined as dams with a height of meters or greater from the lowest foundation to crest or dams between meters and meters impounding more than million cubic_meters; All other dams regardless of size or retention capacity that icould cause safety_risks, such as an unusually large flood_handling requirement, location in a zone of high seismicity, foundations that are complex and difficult to prepare, retention of toxic materials, or potential for significant downstream impacts or are expected to become large_dams during their operating life. The dams referred to in paragraph require: Reviews by an independent panel of experts of the investigation, design, and construction of the dam and the start of operations; Preparation and implementation of the following detailed plans, as further described in Section C: a plan for construction_supervision and quality_assurance, an instrumentation_plan, an operation and maintenance_plan, and an emergency_preparedness_plan; Prequalification of bidders during procurement and bid_tendering; and dams include, for example, a water_storage_dam for a hydro water_supply, irrigation, flood_control, or multipurpose a tailings or a slimes dam, or an ash_impoundment_dam. As part of established dam_safety practices in certain counthe Operation and Maintenance Plan includes the Plan and the emergency_preparedness_plan as sections of the O&M Plan. This method will be accept provided the relevant sections of the O&M Plan contain the and are prepared in accordance with the timing, set out Section Cbelow. Periodic safety_inspections of the dam after completion, and implementation of measures required to address safety deficiencies. The risks associated with a dam are design and situation specific, and will vary depending on structural components, socioeconomic factors and the environment within which the dam is being constructed and will operate. Application of the requirements set out in paragraph will reflect these considerations, and be proportionate to the size, complexity and potential risk of the dam. Where a dam does not fall into the categories set out in paragraph 2, dam_safety measures designed by qualified engineers in accordance with will be adopted and implemented. The Panel referred to in paragraph above consists of three or more experts, appointed by the Borrower and acceptable to the Bank, with expertise in the various technical fields relevant to the safety aspects of the particular dam. The Panel will review and advise the Borrower on matters relative to dam_safety and other critical aspects of the dam, its appurtenant structures, the catchment_area, the area surrounding the reservoir, and downstream areas. The Borrower will normally extend the Panel\u2019s composition and terms of reference beyond dam_safety, to cover such areas as project formulation; technical_design; construction procedures; and, for water_storage dams, associated works such as power facilities, river diversion during construction, ship lifts, and fish ladders. The Borrower will contract the services of the Panel and will provide administrative support for its activities. Beginning as early in project_preparation as possible, the Borrower will arrange for periodic Panel meetings and reviews, which will continue through the investigation, design, construction, and initial_filling and start_up phases of the dam. The Borrower will inform the Bank in advance of the Panel meetings. After each meeting, the Panel In such circumstances, the Borrower will confirm, through the , that there will be no or negligible risk of significant_adverse_impacts due to potential failure of the dam_structure to local_communities and assets, including assets to be financed as part of the proposed project. Such dams could include farm ponds, local silt retention dams and low embankment tanks. The number, professional breadth, technical_expertise, and experience of Panel members are appropriate to the size, complexity, and hazard potential of the dam under consideration. For high_hazard dams, in particular, the Panel members will possess recognized international expertise in their field. If the Bank\u2019s involvement begins at a later stage than project_preparation, the Panel is constituted as soon as possible and reviews any aspects of the project that have already been carried out. The Bank will normally send an observer to these meetings. provide the Borrower with a written report of conclusions and recommendations, signed by participating member; the Borrower will proa copy of the Panel\u2019s report to the Bank. Folthe filling of the reservoir and start_up of the the Bank will reviews the Panel\u2019s findings and If no significant difficulties are in the filling and start_up of the dam, Borrower may disband the Panel. Existing dams and dams under construction Where a project relies or may rely on the perforof an existing dam or a dam under construc- in the Borrower\u2019s territory, the Borrower arrange for one or more independent dam specialist to: inspect and evaluate the safety status the existing dam or , its appurtenances, and performance history; review and evaluate the operation and maintenance procedures; cproide a written report of findings and for any remedial_work or safety_measures necessary to upgrade the existing or to an acceptable standard of safety. Such projects include, for example, power staor water_supply_systems that draw directly a reservoir controlled by an existing dam or a diversion dams or hydraulic structures downfrom an existing dam or a , where failure the upstream dam could cause extensive_damage to or failure of the project facilities; and irrigaor water_supply_projects that will depend on storage and operation of an existing dam or a for their supply of water and could not funcif the dam failed. They also include projects require increases in the capacity of an existdam, or changes in the characteristics of the materials, where failure of the existing could cause extensive_damage to or failure of facilities. The Borrower may use a previously prepared safety_assessment or recommendations for needed in an existing dam or , an effective dam_safety program is already in and full_level inspections and dam assessments of the existing dam or have been conducted and documented, and are to the Bank. For projects that include additional dam_safety or require remedial_work, the Borrower require that: the dam is designed and its is supervised by competent profesand the reports and plans required for a dam ) are prepared implemented. For high_hazard cases involvsignificant and complex remedial_work, the Borrower will also employ a panel of independent_experts on the same basis as for a new_dam Plan for construction_supervision and quality_assurance. This plan will set out details of the organization, staffing levels, procedures, equipment and qualifications for supervision of the construction of a new_dam or of remedial_work on an existing dam. For a dam other than a water_storage_dam, this plan takes into account the usual long construction_period, covering the supervision requirements as the dam grows in height\u2014with any accompanying changes in construction_materials or the characteristics of the impounded material\u2014over a period of years. This plan will be prepared and submitted to the Bank during project_preparation. Instrumentation_plan. This is a detailed plan for the installation of instruments to monitor and record dam behavior and the related hydrometeorological, structural and seismic factors.

The O&Mplan for a dam other than a water_storage_dam, in particular, will reflect changes in the dam\u2019s structure or in the nature of the impounded material that may be expected over a period of years. Elements required to finalize the plan and initiate operations are normally financed under the project. a preliminary plan will be prepared and provided to the Bank during project_preparation. The plan will be refined and completed during project_implementation. The final plan will be completed not less than six months prior to the start of the initial_filling of the reservoir. Elements required to finalize the plan and initiate operations are normally financed under the project. Emergency_preparedness_plan. This plan will specify the roles of responsible parties when dam failure is considered imminent, or when expected operational flow release threatens downstream life, property, or economic operations that depend on river flow levels. It will include the following: clear statements on the responsibility for decision_making relating to dam operations and for the related emergency communications; maps outlining inundation levels for various emergency conditions; flood warning system characteristics; and procedures for evacuating threatened areas and mobilizing emergency forces and equipment. The plan for emergency communication will include the mechanism through which potentially affected downstream communities will be informed. The broad framework plan and an estimate of funds needed to prepare the plan in detail will be prepared and provided to the Bank during project_preparation. The plan itself will be prepared during implementation and is provided to the Panel and Bank for review not later than one year before the projected date of initial_filling of the reservoir. land_acquisition, on land_use and resettlement"

    "text":"introduction\n1. ESS5 recognizes that project-related land\nacquisition and restrictions on land use can\nhave adverse impacts on communities and\npersons. Project-related land acquisition1\nor restrictions on land use2 may cause\nphysical displacement (relocation, loss of\nresidential land or loss of shelter), eco-\nnomic displacement (loss of land, assets or\naccess to assets, leading to loss of income\nsources or other means of livelihood),3 or\nboth. The term \u201cinvoluntary resettlement\u201d\nrefers to these impacts. Resettlement is\nconsidered involuntary when affected per-\nsons or communities do not have the right\nto refuse land acquisition or restrictions on\nland use that result in displacement.\n1 \u201cLand acquisition\u201d refers to all methods of obtaining land for\nproject purposes, which may include outright purchase, expro-\npriation of property and acquisition of access rights, such as\neasements or rights of way.

These may include restrictions on access to legally desig-\nnated parks and protected areas, restrictions on access to other\ncommon property resources, and restrictions on land use within\nutility easements or safety zones.\n3 \u201cLivelihood\u201d refers to the full range of means that individu-\nals, families and communities utilize to make a living, such as\nwage-based income, agriculture, fishing, foraging, other natural\nresource-based livelihoods, petty trade and bartering.\n1707130_Environmental_and_Social_Framework.indd 53\n\nrestrictions\ninvoluntary\nExperience and research indicate that physical\neconomic displacement, if unmitigated, may\nrise to severe economic, social and environ-\nrisks: production systems may be disman-\npeople face impoverishment if their productive\nor other income sources are lost; people\nbe relocated to environments where their pro-\nskills are less applicable and the competi- .\nfor resources greater; community institutions\nsocial networks may be weakened; kin groups\nbe dispersed; and cultural identity, traditional\nand the potential for mutual help may\ndiminished or lost.

This ESS applies to permanent or temporary phys-\nical and economic displacement resulting from the\nfollowing types of land acquisition or restrictions on\n6 \u201cReplacement cost\u201d is defined as a method of valuation yielding\ncompensation sufficient to replace assets, plus necessary trans-\naction costs associated with asset replacement. Where func-\ntioning markets exist, replacement cost is the market value as\nestablished through independent and competent real estate val-\nuation, plus transaction costs. Where functioning markets do not\nexist, replacement cost may be determined through alternative\nmeans, such as calculation of output value for land or productive\nassets, or the undepreciated value of replacement material and\nlabor for construction of structures or other fixed assets, plus\ntransaction costs. In all instances where physical displacement\nresults in loss of shelter, replacement cost must at least be suf-\nficient to enable purchase or construction of housing that meets\nacceptable minimum community standards of quality and safety.\nThe valuation method for determining replacement cost should\nbe documented and included in relevant resettlement planning\ndocuments. Transaction costs include administrative charges,\nregistration or title fees, reasonable moving expenses, and any\nsimilar costs imposed on affected persons. To ensure compen-\nsation at replacement cost, planned compensation rates may\nrequire updating in project areas where inflation is high or the\nperiod of time between calculation of compensation rates and\ndelivery of compensation is extensive.\n7\u201c Security of tenure\u201d means that resettled individuals or com-\nmunities are resettled to a site that they can legally occupy, where\nthey are protected from the risk of eviction and where the tenure\nrights provided to them are socially and culturally appropriate.\nIn no event will resettled persons be provided tenure rights that\nare in effect weaker than the rights they had to the land or assets\nfrom which they have been displaced.\n54\n1707130_Environmental_and_Social_Framework.indd 54\n\nuse undertaken or imposed in connection with\nimplementation:\nLand rights or land use rights acquired or\nrestricted through expropriation or other com-\npulsory procedures in accordance with national\nlaw;\nLand rights or land use rights acquired or\nrestricted through negotiated settlements with\nproperty owners or those with legal rights to\nthe land, if failure to reach settlement would\nhave resulted in expropriation or other com-\npulsory procedures;8\nRestrictions on land use and access to natural\nresources that cause a community or groups\nwithin a community to lose access to resource\nusage where they have traditional or customary\ntenure, or recognizable usage rights.

This ESS does not apply to impacts on incomes\nor livelihoods that are not a direct result of land\nacquisition or land use restrictions imposed by the\nproject. Such impacts will be addressed in accor-\ndance with ESS1.\n6. This ESS does not apply to voluntary, legally\nrecorded market transactions in which the seller is\ngiven a genuine opportunity to retain the land and\nto refuse to sell it, and is fully informed about avail-\nable choices and their implications. However, where\nsuch voluntary land transactions may result in the\ndisplacement of persons, other than the seller, who\noccupy, use or claim rights to the land in question,\nthis ESS will apply.11\n7.

The Borrower will demonstrate that involun-\ntary land acquisition or restrictions on land use are\nlimited to direct project requirements for clearly\nspecified project purposes within a clearly specified\nperiod of time. The Borrower will consider feasible\nalternative project designs to avoid or minimize land\nacquisition or restrictions on land use, especially\nwhere this would result in physical or economic dis-\nplacement, while balancing environmental, social,\nand financial costs and benefits, and paying par-\nticular attention to gender impacts and impacts on\nthe poor and vulnerable.\nCompensation and benefits for affected persons\n12. When land acquisition or restrictions on land\nuse (whether permanent or temporary) cannot be\navoided, the Borrower will offer affected persons\ncompensation at replacement cost, and other assis-\ntance as may be necessary to help them improve\nor at least restore their standards of living or live-\nlihoods, sub(cid:191)ect to the pro(cid:253)isions of paragraph(cid:1053)(cid:882)(cid:886)\nthrough 36 of this ESS.15\n13. Compensation standards for categories of land\nand fixed assets will be disclosed and applied con-\nsistently. Compensation rates may be subject to\nupward adjustment where negotiation strategies\nare employed. In all cases, a clear basis for calcu-\nlation of compensation will be documented, and\ncompensation distributed in accordance with trans-\nparent procedures.\n14. Where livelihoods of displaced persons are\nland-based,16 or where land is collectively owned,\nthe Borrower will offer the displaced persons an\noption for replacement land in accordance with\nparagraph 35(a), unless it can be demonstrated to\nthe Bank\u2019s satisfaction that equivalent replacement\nland is unavailable. As the nature and objectives of\nthe project may allow, the Borrower will also pro-\nvide opportunities to displaced communities and\npersons to derive appropriate development bene-\nfits from the project. In the case of affected persons\nunder paragraph 10 (c), resettlement assistance will\nbe provided in lieu of compensation for land, as\ndescribed in paragraphs 29 and 34 (c).\n15. The Borrower will take possession of acquired\nland and related assets only after compensation in\naccordance with this ESS has been made available\n15 At the request of affected persons, it may be necessary to\nacquire entire land parcels if partial acquisition would render the\nremainder economically unviable, or make the remaining parcel\nunsafe or inaccessible for human use or occupancy.\n16 The term \u201cland-based\u201d includes livelihood activities such as\nrotational cropping and grazing of livestock as well as the har-\nvesting of natural resources.\n56\n1707130_Environmental_and_Social_Framework.indd 56\n\nwhere applicable, displaced people have been\nand moving allowances have been pro-\nto the displaced persons in addition to com-\nIn addition, livelihood restoration and\nprograms will commence in a timely\nin order to ensure that affected persons are\nprepared to take advantage of alterna-\nlivelihood opportunities as the need to do so\nIn certain cases there may be significant dif-\nrelated to the payment of compensation\nparticular affected persons, for example, where\nefforts to contact absentee owners have\nwhere project-affected persons have rejected\nthat has been offered to them in\nwith the approved plan, or where com-\nclaims to the ownership of lands or assets are\nto lengthy legal proceedings.

Implementation of the Borrower\u2019s plan will be\nconsidered completed when the adverse impacts\nof resettlement have been addressed in a manner\nthat is consistent with the relevant plan as well as\nthe objectives of this ESS. For all projects with sig-\nnificant involuntary resettlement impacts, the Bor-\nrower will commission an external completion audit\nof the plan when all mitigation measures have been\nsubstantially completed. The completion audit will\nbe undertaken by competent resettlement profes-\nsionals, will assess whether livelihoods and living\nstandards have been improved or at least restored\nand, as necessary, will propose corrective actions to\nmeet objectives not yet achieved.\n25. Where the likely nature or magnitude of the\nland acquisition or restrictions on land use related\nto a project with potential to cause physical and\/or\neconomic displacement is unknown during project\npreparation, the Borrower will develop a framework\nestablishing general principles and procedures\ncompatible with this ESS. Once the individual proj-\nect components are defined and the necessary\ninformation becomes available, such a framework\nwill be expanded into one or more specific plans\nproportionate to potential risks and impacts. No\nphysical and\/or economic displacement will occur\nuntil plans required by this ESS have been finalized\nand approved by the Bank.\nB. displacement\nPhysical displacement\n26. In the case of physical displacement, the Bor-\nrower will develop a plan that covers, at a minimum,\nthe applicable requirements of this ESS regardless\nof the number of people affected. The plan will be\ndesigned to mitigate the negative impacts of dis-\nplacement and, as warranted, to identify develop-\nment opportunities. It will include a resettlement\nbudget and implementation schedule, and establish\nthe entitlements of all categories of affected per-\nsons (including host communities). Particular atten-\ntion will be paid to gender aspects and the needs\nof the poor and the vulnerable. The Borrower will\ndocument all transactions to acquire land rights,\nprovision of compensation and other assistance\nassociated with relocation activities.\n27. If people living in the project area are required\nto move to another location, the Borrower will:\n(cid:1010)a(cid:1011)(cid:1053)offer displaced persons choices among feasible\nresettlement options, including adequate replace-\nment housing or cash compensation; and (b) pro-\nvide relocation assistance suited to the needs of\neach group of displaced persons. New resettlement\nsites will offer living conditions at least equivalent\n58\n1707130_Environmental_and_Social_Framework.indd 58\n\nthose previously enjoyed, or consistent with pre-\nminimum codes or standards, whichever set\nstandards is higher. If new resettlement sites are\nbe prepared, host communities will be consulted\nplanning options, and resettlement plans\nensure continued access, at least at existing lev-\nor standards, for host communities to facilities\nservices.

The Borrower will not resort to forced evictions\nof affected persons. \u201cForced eviction\u201d is defined as\nthe permanent or temporary removal against the\nwill of individuals, families, and\/or communities\nfrom the homes and\/or land which they occupy\nwithout the provision of, and access to, appropri-\nate forms of legal and other protection, including\nall applicable procedures and principles in this ESS.\nThe exercise of eminent domain, compulsory acqui-\nsition or similar powers by a Borrower will not be\nconsidered to be forced eviction providing it com-\nplies with the requirements of national law and the\nprovisions of this ESS, and is conducted in a man-\nner consistent with basic principles of due process\n(including provision of adequate advance notice,\nmeaningful opportunities to lodge grievances and\nappeals, and avoidance of the use of unnecessary,\ndisproportionate or excessive force).\n32. As an alternative to displacement, the Borrower\nmay consider negotiating in situ land develop-\nment arrangements by which those to be affected\nmay elect to accept a partial loss of land or local-\nized relocation in return for improvements that will\nincrease the value of their property after develop-\nment. Any person not wishing to participate will be\nallowed to opt instead for full compensation and\nother assistance as required in this ESS.\nEconomic displacement\n33. In the case of projects affecting livelihoods or\nincome generation, the Borrower\u2019s plan will include\nmeasures to allow affected persons to improve, or at\nleast restore, their incomes or livelihoods. The plan\nwill establish the entitlements of affected persons\nand\/or communities, paying particular attention to\ngender aspects and the needs of vulnerable seg-\nments of communities, and will ensure that these\nare provided in a transparent, consistent, and equi-\ntable manner. The plan will incorporate arrange-\nments to monitor the effectiveness of livelihood\nmeasures during implementation, as well as evalu-\nation once implementation is completed. The miti-\ngation of economic displacement will be considered\ncomplete when the completion audit concludes that\naffected persons or communities have received all\nof the assistance for which they are eligible, and\nhave been provided with adequate opportunity to\nreestablish their livelihoods.\n34. Economically displaced persons who face loss\nof assets or access to assets will be compensated\nfor such loss at replacement cost:\n(a) In cases where land acquisition or restrictions\non land use affect commercial enterprises,24\n24T his includes shops, restaurants, services, manufacturing\nfacilities and other enterprises, regardless of size and whether\nlicensed or unlicensed.\n1707130_Environmental_and_Social_Framework.indd 59\n\naffected business owners will be compensated\nfor the cost of identifying a viable alternative\nlocation; for lost net income during the period\nof transition; for the cost of the transfer and\nreinstallation of the plant, machinery, or other\nequipment; and for reestablishing commer-\ncial activities. Affected employees will receive\nassistance for temporary loss of wages and, if\nnecessary, assistance in identifying alternative\nemployment opportunities;\nIn cases affecting persons with legal rights or\nclaims to land that are recognized or recogniz-\nable under national law (see paragraph 10 (a)\nand (b)), replacement property (e.g., agricul-\ntural or commercial sites) of equal or greater\nvalue will be provided, or, where appropriate,\ncash compensation at replacement cost; and\nEconomically displaced persons who are with-\nout legally recognizable claims to land (see\nparagraph(cid:1053)(cid:881)(cid:880)(cid:1053)(cid:1010)c(cid:1011)(cid:1011) will be compensated for lost\nassets other than land (such as crops, irriga-\ntion infrastructure and other improvements\nmade to the land), at replacement cost. Addi-\ntionally, the Borrower will provide assistance in\nlieu of land compensation sufficient to provide\nsuch persons with an opportunity to reestab-\nlish livelihoods elsewhere. The Borrower is not\nrequired to compensate or assist persons who\nencroach on the project area after the cutoff\ndate for eligibility.\nEconomically displaced persons will be pro-\nopportunities to improve, or at least restore,\nmeans of income-earning capacity, production\nand standards of living:\nFor persons whose livelihoods are land-based,\nreplacement land that has a combination of\nproductive potential, locational advantages,\nand other factors at least equivalent to that\nbeing lost will be offered where feasible;\nFor persons whose livelihoods are natural\nresource-based and where project-related\nrestrictions on access envisaged in paragraph 4\napply, measures will be implemented to either\nallow continued access to affected resources\nor to provide access to alternative resources\n5sse\nwith equivalent livelihood-earning potential\nand accessibility. Where common property\nresources are affected, benefits and compen-\nsation associated with restrictions on natural\nresource usage may be collective in nature; and\nIf it is demonstrated that replacement land or\nresources are unavailable, the Borrower will\noffer economically displaced persons options\nfor alternative income earning opportunities,\nsuch as credit facilities, skills training, business\nstart-up assistance, employment opportunities,\nor cash assistance additional to compensation 59\n5\/25\/17\n\nfor assets. Cash assistance alone, however,\nfrequently fails to provide affected persons\nwith the productive means or skills to restore\nlivelihoods.\n36. Transitional support will be provided as neces-\nsary to all economically displaced persons, based\non a reasonable estimate of the time required to\nrestore their income-earning capacity, production\nlevels, and standards of living.\nc. collaboration with other responsible\nagencies or subnational jurisdictions\n37. The Borrower will establish means of collabora-\ntion between the agency or entity responsible for\nproject implementation and any other governmen-\ntal agencies, subnational jurisdictions or entities\nthat are responsible for any aspects of land acqui-\nsition, resettlement planning, or provision of nec-\nessary assistance. In addition, where the capacity\nof other responsible agencies is limited, the Bor-\nrower will actively support resettlement planning,\nimplementation, and monitoring. If the procedures\nor standards of other responsible agencies do not\nmeet the relevant requirements of this ESS, the Bor-\nrower will prepare supplemental arrangements or\nprovisions for inclusion in the resettlement plan to\naddress identified shortcomings. The plan will also\nspecify financial responsibilities for each of the\nagencies involved, appropriate timing and sequenc-\ning for implementation steps, and coordination\narrangements for addressing financial contingen-\ncies or responding to unforeseen circumstances.\nd. technical and financial assistance\n38. The Borrower may request technical assistance\nfrom the Bank to strengthen Borrower capacity,\nor the capacity of other responsible agencies, for\nresettlement planning, implementation and moni-\ntoring. Such forms of assistance may include staff\ntraining, assistance in formulating new regulations\nor policies relating to land acquisition or other\naspects of resettlement, financing for assessments\nor other investment costs associated with physical\nor economic displacement, or other purposes.\n39. The Borrower may request the Bank to finance\neither a component of the main investment caus-\ning displacement and requiring resettlement, or a\nfree-standing resettlement project with appropriate\ncross-conditionalities, processed and implemented\nin parallel with the investment that causes the dis-\nplacement. The Borrower may also request the Bank\nto finance resettlement even though it is not financ-\ning the main investment that makes resettlement\nnecessary.\n60\n1707130_Environmental_and_Social_Framework.indd 60\n\n1. involuntary resettlement\nThis Annex describes the elements of the plans\nphysical and\/or economic displacement\nin paragraph 21 of ESS5.

Process framework\n32. A process framework is prepared when Bank-\nsupported projects may cause restrictions in access\nto natural resources in legally designated parks and\nprotected areas. The purpose of the process frame-\nwork is to establish a process by which members\nof potentially affected communities participate in\ndesign of project components, determination of\nmeasures necessary to achieve the objectives of\nthis ESS, and implementation and monitoring of rel-\nevant project activities.\n64\n1707130_Environmental_and_Social_Framework.indd 64\n\nSpecifically, the process framework describes\nprocesses by which the following\nwill be accomplished:\nProject components will be prepared and\nimplemented. The document should briefly\ndescribe the project and components or activi-\nties that may involve new or more stringent\nrestrictions on natural resource use.

    "text_clean":"introduction recognizes that project-related land acquisition and restrictions on land use can have adverse impacts on communities and persons. Project-related land acquisition or restrictions on land use may cause physical displacement , economic displacement , or both. The term \u201cinvoluntary resettlement\u201d refers to these impacts. Resettlement is considered involuntary when affected persons or communities do not have the right to refuse land acquisition or restrictions on land use that result in displacement. \u201cLand acquisition\u201d refers to all methods of obtaining land for project purposes, which may include outright purchase, expropriation of property and acquisition of access rights, such as easements or rights of way. Land acquisition may also include: aacuisition of unoccupied or unutilied land whether or not the landholder relies upon such land for income or livelihood purposes; repossession of public land that is used or occupied by individuals or households; and project impacts that result in land being submerged or otherwise rendered unusable or inaccessible. \u201cLand\u201d includes anything growing on or permanently affixed to land, such as crops, buildings and other improvements, and appurtenant water bodies. 2\u201c Restrictions on land use\u201d refers to limitations or prohibitions on the use of agricultural, residential, commercial or other land that are directly introduced and put into effect as part of the project. These may include restrictions on access to legally designated parks and protected areas, restrictions on access to other common property resources, and restrictions on land use within utility easements or safety zones. \u201cLivelihood\u201d refers to the full range of means that individuals, families and communities utilize to make a living, such as wage-based income, agriculture, fishing, foraging, other natural resource-based livelihoods, petty trade and bartering. restrictions involuntary Experience and research indicate that physical economic displacement, if unmitigated, may rise to severe economic, social and environrisks: production systems may be dismanpeople face impoverishment if their productive or other income sources are lost; people be relocated to environments where their pros kills are less applicable and the competi- . for resources greater; community institutions social networks may be weakened; kin groups be dispersed; and cultural identity, traditional and the potential for mutual help may diminished or lost. For these reasons, involresettlement should be avoided. Where resettlement is unavoidable, it will be and appropriate measures to mitigate impacts on displaced persons will be planned and implemented. To avoid involuntary resettlement or, when unavoidable, minimize involuntary resettlement by exploring project design alternatives. To avoid forced eviction. To mitigate unavoidable adverse social and economic impacts from land acquisition or restrictions on land use by: aproiding timely compensation for loss of assets at replacement voidance is the preferred approach in accordance with the hierarchy in . It is especially important to avoid or economic displacement of those socially or ecovulnerable to hardship as a result. However, avoidmay not be the preferred approach in situations where health or safety would be adversely affected as a result. may also be situations where resettlement can provide development opportunities for households or communiincluding improved housing and public health conditions, security of tenure or other improvements to local standards. See paragraph cost and bassi sting displaced persons in their efforts to improve, or at least restore, their livelihoods and living standards, in real terms, to pre-displacement levels or to levels prevailing prior to the beginning of project implementation, whichever is higher. To improve living conditions of poor or vulnerable persons who are physically displaced, through provision of adequate housing, access to services and facilities, and security of tenure. To conceive and execute resettlement activities as sustainable development programs, providing sufficient investment resources to enable displaced persons to benefit directly from the project, as the nature of the project may warrant. To ensure that resettlement activities are planned and implemented with appropriate disclosure of information, meaningful consultation, and the informed participation of those affected. Scope of application The applicability of is established during the described in . This applies to permanent or temporary physical and economic displacement resulting from the following types of land acquisition or restrictions on \u201cReplacement cost\u201d is defined as a method of valuation yielding compensation sufficient to replace assets, plus necessary transaction costs associated with asset replacement. Where functioning markets exist, replacement cost is the market value as established through independent and competent real estate valuation, plus transaction costs. Where functioning markets do not exist, replacement cost may be determined through alternative means, such as calculation of output value for land or productive assets, or the undepreciated value of replacement material and labor for construction of structures or other fixed assets, plus transaction costs. In all instances where physical displacement results in loss of shelter, replacement cost must at least be sufficient to enable purchase or construction of housing that meets acceptable minimum community standards of quality and safety. The valuation method for determining replacement cost should be documented and included in relevant resettlement planning documents. Transaction costs include administrative charges, registration or title fees, reasonable moving expenses, and any similar costs imposed on affected persons. To ensure compensation at replacement cost, planned compensation rates may require updating in project areas where inflation is high or the period of time between calculation of compensation rates and delivery of compensation is extensive. 7\u201c Security of tenure\u201d means that resettled individuals or communities are resettled to a site that they can legally occupy, where they are protected from the risk of eviction and where the tenure rights provided to them are socially and culturally appropriate. In no event will resettled persons be provided tenure rights that are in effect weaker than the rights they had to the land or assets from which they have been displaced. use undertaken or imposed in connection with implementation: Land rights or land use rights acquired or restricted through expropriation or other compulsory procedures in accordance with national law; Land rights or land use rights acquired or restricted through negotiated settlements with property owners or those with legal rights to the land, if failure to reach settlement would have resulted in expropriation or other compulsory procedures; Restrictions on land use and access to natural resources that cause a community or groups within a community to lose access to resource usage where they have traditional or customary tenure, or recognizable usage rights. This may include situations where legally designated protected areas, forests, biodiversity areas or buffer zones are established in connection with the project; Relocation of people without formal, traditional, or recognizable usage rights, who are occupying or utilizing land prior to a project specific cut-off date; Displacement of people as a result of project impacts that render their land unusable or inaccessible; Restriction on access to land or use of other resources including communal property and natural resources such as marine and aquatic resources, timber and non-timber forest products, fresh water, medicinal plants, hunting and gathering grounds and grazing and cropping areas; Notwithstanding the application of this to such situations, Borrower is encouraged to seek negotiated settlements with persons in a manner meeting the requirements of this in order to help avoid administrative or judicial delays assowith formal expropriation, and to the extent possible to the impacts on affected persons associated with formal such situations, affected persons frequently do not have forownership. This may include freshwater and marine environ This does not apply to restrictions of access to natural under community-based natural resource manageprojects, i.e., where the community using the resources coldecides to restrict access to these resources, provided an assessment satisfactory to the Bank establishes that the decision-making process is adequate and reflects informed consensus, and that appropriate measures been agreed and put in place to mitigate adverse impacts, if on the vulnerable members of the community. Land rights or claims to land or resources relinquished by individuals or communities without full payment of compensation; and Land acquisition or land use restrictions occurring prior to the project, but which were undertaken or initiated in anticipation of, or in preparation for, the project. This does not apply to impacts on incomes or livelihoods that are not a direct result of land acquisition or land use restrictions imposed by the project. Such impacts will be addressed in accordance with . This does not apply to voluntary, legally recorded market transactions in which the seller is given a genuine opportunity to retain the land and to refuse to sell it, and is fully informed about available choices and their implications. However, where such voluntary land transactions may result in the displacement of persons, other than the seller, who occupy, use or claim rights to the land in question, this will apply. Where a project supports land titling or other activities intended to confirm, regularize or determine land rights, a social, legal and institutional In some circumstances, it may be proposed that part or all of the land to be used by the project is donated on a voluntary basis without payment of full compensation. Subject to prior Bank approval, this may be acceptable providing the Borrower demonstrates that: the potential donor or donors have been appropriately informed and consulted about the project and the choices available to them; potential donors are aware that refusal is an option, and have confirmed in writing their willingness to proceed with the donation; the amount of land being donated is minor and will not reduce the donor\u2019s remaining land area below that required to maintain the donor\u2019s livelihood at current levels; no household relocation is involved; the donor is expected to benefit directly from the project; and for community or collective land, donation can only occur with the consent of individuals using or occupying the land. The Borrower will maintain a transparent record of all consultations and agreements reached. This may include situations where a project supports voluntary transactions between communities, governments and investors involving significant areas of land . In such cases, in applying the relevant provisions of this , special care must be taken to ensure: athat all tenure rights and claims affecting the land in question are systematically and impartially identified; that potentially affected individuals, groups or communities are meaningfully consulted, informed of their rights, and provided reliable information concerning environmental, economic, social and food security impacts of the proposed investment; that community stakeholders are enabled to negotiate fair value and appropriate conditions for the transfer; that appropriate compensation, benefit sharing and grievance redress mechanisms are put in place; that terms and conditions of the transfer are transparent; and mechanisms are put in place for monitoring compliance with those terms and conditions. will be required under .

This does not apply to disputes private parties in land titling or related However, where persons are required to land as a direct result of a project-supported that the land in question is state this will apply . This does not apply to land use planning or regulation of natural resources to promote their on a regional, national or subnational .

General classification Affected persons may be classified as persons: Who have formal legal rights to land or assets; Who do not have formal legal rights to land or assets, but have a claim to land or assets that is recognized or recognizable under national law; or Who have no recognizable legal right or claim to the land or assets they occupy or use. census described in paragraph will establish status of the affected persons. , para. See , footnote uch claims could be derived from adverse possession or from or traditional tenure arrangements. Project design The Borrower will demonstrate that involuntary land acquisition or restrictions on land use are limited to direct project requirements for clearly specified project purposes within a clearly specified period of time. The Borrower will consider feasible alternative project designs to avoid or minimize land acquisition or restrictions on land use, especially where this would result in physical or economic displacement, while balancing environmental, social, and financial costs and benefits, and paying particular attention to gender impacts and impacts on the poor and vulnerable. Compensation and benefits for affected persons When land acquisition or restrictions on land use cannot be avoided, the Borrower will offer affected persons compensation at replacement cost, and other assistance as may be necessary to help them improve or at least restore their standards of living or livelihoods, subect to the proisions of paragraph through of this . Compensation standards for categories of land and fixed assets will be disclosed and applied consistently. Compensation rates may be subject to upward adjustment where negotiation strategies are employed. In all cases, a clear basis for calculation of compensation will be documented, and compensation distributed in accordance with transparent procedures. Where livelihoods of displaced persons are land-based, or where land is collectively owned, the Borrower will offer the displaced persons an option for replacement land in accordance with paragraph 3, unless it can be demonstrated to the Bank\u2019s satisfaction that equivalent replacement land is unavailable. As the nature and objectives of the project may allow, the Borrower will also provide opportunities to displaced communities and persons to derive appropriate development benefits from the project. In the case of affected persons under paragraph , resettlement assistance will be provided in lieu of compensation for land, as described in paragraphs and . The Borrower will take possession of acquired land and related assets only after compensation in accordance with this has been made available At the request of affected persons, it may be necessary to acquire entire land parcels if partial acquisition would render the remainder economically unviable, or make the remaining parcel unsafe or inaccessible for human use or occupancy. The term \u201cland-based\u201d includes livelihood activities such as rotational cropping and grazing of livestock as well as the harvesting of natural resources. where applicable, displaced people have been and moving allowances have been proto the displaced persons in addition to com In addition, livelihood restoration and programs will commence in a timely in order to ensure that affected persons are prepared to take advantage of alternalivelihood opportunities as the need to do so In certain cases there may be significant difrelated to the payment of compensation particular affected persons, for example, where efforts to contact absentee owners have where project-affected persons have rejected that has been offered to them in with the approved plan, or where comclaims to the ownership of lands or assets are to lengthy legal proceedings. On an excepbasis, with prior agreement of the Bank, and the Borrower demonstrates that all reason efforts to resolve such matters have been taken, Borrower may deposit compensation funds as by the plan into an interest-bearing or other deposit account and proceed with relevant project activities. Compensation placed escrow will be made available to eligible persons a timely manner as issues are resolved. engagement The Borrower will engage with affected comincluding host communities, through process of stakeholder engagement described . Decision-making processes related to and livelihood restoration will include and alternatives from which affected permay choose. Disclosure of relevant information meaningful participation of affected communiand persons will take place during the considof alternative project designs referred to in 1, and thereafter throughout the planimplementation, monitoring, and evaluation the compensation process, livelihood restoration and relocation process. Additional proviapply to consultations with displaced Indig Peoples, in accordance with . The consultation process should ensure that perspectives are obtained and their inter factored into all aspects of resettlement planand implementation. Addressing livelihood may require intra-household analysis in where women\u2019s and men\u2019s livelihoods are differently. Women\u2019s and men\u2019s preferin terms of compensation mechanisms, such replacement land or alternative access to natural rather than in cash, should be explored. Grievance mechanism The Borrower will ensure that a grievance mechanism for the project is in place, in accordance with as early as possible in project development to address specific concerns about compensation, relocation or livelihood restoration measures raised by displaced persons in a timely fashion. Where possible, such grievance mechanisms will utilize existing formal or informal grievance mechanisms suitable for project purposes, supplemented as needed with project-specific arrangements designed to resolve disputes in an impartial manner. Planning and implementation Where land acquisition or restrictions on land use are unavoidable, the Borrower will, as part of the , conduct a census to identify the persons who will be affected by the project, to establish an inventory of land and assets to be affected, to determine who will be eligible for compensation and assistance, and to discourage ineligible persons, such as opportunistic settlers, from claiming benefits. The social assessment will also address the claims of communities or groups who, for valid reasons, may not be present in the project area during the time of the census, such as seasonal resource users. In conjunction with the census, the Borrower will establish a cutoff date for eligibility. Information regarding the cut-off date will be well documented and will be disseminated throughout the project area at regular intervals in written and nonwritten forms and in relevant local languages. This will include posted warnings that persons settling in the project area after the cutoff date may be subject to removal. To address the issues identified in the , the Borrower will prepare a plan proportionate to the risks and impacts associated with the project: For projects with minor land acquisition or restrictions on land use, as a result of which there will be no significant impact on incomes See Annex Such inventory should include a detailed account, derived through a consultative, impartial and transparent process, of the full range of rights held or asserted by affected people, including those based on custom or practice, secondary rights such as rights of access or use for livelihoods purposes, rights held in common, etc. Documentation of ownership or occupancy and compensation payments should be issued in the names of both spouses or single heads of households as relevant, and other resettlement assistance, such as skills training, access to credit, and job opportunities, should be equally available to women and adapted to their needs. Where national law and tenure systems do not recognize the rights of women to hold or contract in property, measures should be considered to provide women as much protection as possible with the objective to achieve equity with men. See Annex or livelihoods, the plan will establish eligibility criteria for affected persons, set out procedures and standards for compensation, and incorporate arrangements for consultations, monitoring and addressing grievances; For projects causing physical displacement, the plan will set out the additional measures relevant to relocation of affected persons; For projects involving economic displacement with significant impacts on livelihoods or income generation, the plan will set out the additional measures relating to livelihood improvement or restoration; and For projects that may impose changes in land use that restrict access to resources in legally designated parks or protected areas or other common property resources on which local people may depend for livelihood purposes, the plan will establish a participatory process for determining appropriate restrictions on use and set out the mitigation measures to address adverse impacts on livelihoods that may result from such restrictions. The Borrower\u2019s plan will establish the roles and relating to financing and implemenand include arrangements for contingency to meet unanticipated costs, as well as for timely and coordinated response unforeseen circumstances impeding progress desired outcomes. The full costs of reset activities necessary to achieve the objecof the project are included in the total costs of project. The costs of resettlement, like the costs other project activities, are treated as a charge the economic benefits of the project; and net benefits to resettlers are added to the stream of the project. The Borrower will establish procedures to moniand evaluate the implementation of the plan will take corrective action as necessary during to achieve the objectives of this The extent of monitoring activities will be proto the project\u2019s risks and impacts. For all with significant involuntary resettlement the Borrower will retain competent reset professionals to monitor the implementaof resettlement plans, design corrective actions necessary, provide advice on compliance with and produce periodic monitoring reports. persons will be consulted during the moniprocess. Periodic monitoring reports will be or projects with significant resettlement impacts and complex measures, the Borrower may consider preparing a resettlement project for Bank support. prepared and affected persons will be informed about monitoring results in a timely manner. Implementation of the Borrower\u2019s plan will be considered completed when the adverse impacts of resettlement have been addressed in a manner that is consistent with the relevant plan as well as the objectives of this . For all projects with significant involuntary resettlement impacts, the Borrower will commission an external completion audit of the plan when all mitigation measures have been substantially completed. The completion audit will be undertaken by competent resettlement professionals, will assess whether livelihoods and living standards have been improved or at least restored and, as necessary, will propose corrective actions to meet objectives not yet achieved. Where the likely nature or magnitude of the land acquisition or restrictions on land use related to a project with potential to cause physical and or economic displacement is unknown during project preparation, the Borrower will develop a framework establishing general principles and procedures compatible with this . Once the individual project components are defined and the necessary information becomes available, such a framework will be expanded into one or more specific plans proportionate to potential risks and impacts. No physical and or economic displacement will occur until plans required by this have been finalized and approved by the Bank. B. displacement Physical displacement In the case of physical displacement, the Borrower will develop a plan that covers, at a minimum, the applicable requirements of this regardless of the number of people affected. The plan will be designed to mitigate the negative impacts of displacement and, as warranted, to identify development opportunities. It will include a resettlement budget and implementation schedule, and establish the entitlements of all categories of affected persons . Particular attention will be paid to gender aspects and the needs of the poor and the vulnerable. The Borrower will document all transactions to acquire land rights, provision of compensation and other assistance associated with relocation activities. If people living in the project area are required to move to another location, the Borrower will: aoffer displaced persons choices among feasible resettlement options, including adequate replacement housing or cash compensation; and provide relocation assistance suited to the needs of each group of displaced persons. New resettlement sites will offer living conditions at least equivalent those previously enjoyed, or consistent with preminimum codes or standards, whichever set standards is higher. If new resettlement sites are be prepared, host communities will be consulted planning options, and resettlement plans ensure continued access, at least at existing levor standards, for host communities to facilities services. The displaced persons\u2019 preferences respect to relocating in preexisting communiand groups will be respected wherever possible. social and cultural institutions of the dispersons and any host communities will be In the case of physically displaced persons under or , the Borrower will offer the of replacement property of equal or higher with security of tenure, equivalent or better and advantages of location, or cash at replacement cost. Compensation kind should be considered in lieu of cash. In the case of physically displaced persons under , the Borrower will provide arrangeto allow them to obtain adequate housing security of tenure. Where these displaced perown structures, the Borrower will compensate for the loss of assets other than land, such dwellings and other improvements to the land, replacement cost. Based on consultation with displaced persons, the Borrower will provide assistance in lieu of compensation for sufficient for them to restore their standards living at an adequate alternative site. The Borrower is not required to compensate or those who encroach on the project area after cutoff date for eligibility, provided the cut-off has been clearly established and made public. ayment of cash compensation for lost land and other assets be appropriate where: livelihoods are not land-based; are land based but the land taken for the proect a small fraction of the affected asset and the residual land economically viable; or active markets for land, housing, labor exist, displaced persons use such markets, there is supply of land and housing, and the Borrower has to the satisfaction of the Bank that insufficient land is available. here the Borrower demonstrates that an affected person substantial income from multiple illegal rental units, compensation and other assistance that would otherwise available to such person for non-land assets and livelihood under this paragraph may be reduced with the prior of the Bank, to better reflect the objectives of this . elocation of informal settlers in urban areas may involve For example, the relocated families may gain secuof tenure, but they may lose locational advantages that may essential to livelihoods, especially among the poor or vulner Changes in location that may affect livelihood opportunities be addressed in accordance with the relevant provisions this ). The Borrower will not resort to forced evictions of affected persons. \u201cForced eviction\u201d is defined as the permanent or temporary removal against the will of individuals, families, and or communities from the homes and or land which they occupy without the provision of, and access to, appropriate forms of legal and other protection, including all applicable procedures and principles in this . The exercise of eminent domain, compulsory acquisition or similar powers by a Borrower will not be considered to be forced eviction providing it complies with the requirements of national law and the provisions of this , and is conducted in a manner consistent with basic principles of due process . As an alternative to displacement, the Borrower may consider negotiating in situ land development arrangements by which those to be affected may elect to accept a partial loss of land or localized relocation in return for improvements that will increase the value of their property after development. Any person not wishing to participate will be allowed to opt instead for full compensation and other assistance as required in this . Economic displacement In the case of projects affecting livelihoods or income generation, the Borrower\u2019s plan will include measures to allow affected persons to improve, or at least restore, their incomes or livelihoods. The plan will establish the entitlements of affected persons and or communities, paying particular attention to gender aspects and the needs of vulnerable segments of communities, and will ensure that these are provided in a transparent, consistent, and equitable manner. The plan will incorporate arrangements to monitor the effectiveness of livelihood measures during implementation, as well as evaluation once implementation is completed. The mitigation of economic displacement will be considered complete when the completion audit concludes that affected persons or communities have received all of the assistance for which they are eligible, and have been provided with adequate opportunity to reestablish their livelihoods. Economically displaced persons who face loss of assets or access to assets will be compensated for such loss at replacement cost: In cases where land acquisition or restrictions on land use affect commercial enterprises, This includes shops, restaurants, services, manufacturing facilities and other enterprises, regardless of size and whether licensed or unlicensed. affected business owners will be compensated for the cost of identifying a viable alternative location; for lost net income during the period of transition; for the cost of the transfer and reinstallation of the plant, machinery, or other equipment; and for reestablishing commercial activities. Affected employees will receive assistance for temporary loss of wages and, if necessary, assistance in identifying alternative employment opportunities; In cases affecting persons with legal rights or claims to land that are recognized or recognizable under national law and ), replacement property of equal or greater value will be provided, or, where appropriate, cash compensation at replacement cost; and Economically displaced persons who are without legally recognizable claims to land , at replacement cost. Additionally, the Borrower will provide assistance in lieu of land compensation sufficient to provide such persons with an opportunity to reestablish livelihoods elsewhere. The Borrower is not required to compensate or assist persons who encroach on the project area after the cutoff date for eligibility. Economically displaced persons will be proopportunities to improve, or at least restore, means of income-earning capacity, production and standards of living: For persons whose livelihoods are land-based, replacement land that has a combination of productive potential, locational advantages, and other factors at least equivalent to that being lost will be offered where feasible; For persons whose livelihoods are natural resource-based and where project-related restrictions on access envisaged in paragraph apply, measures will be implemented to either allow continued access to affected resources or to provide access to alternative resources with equivalent livelihood-earning potential and accessibility. Where common property resources are affected, benefits and compensation associated with restrictions on natural resource usage may be collective in nature; and If it is demonstrated that replacement land or resources are unavailable, the Borrower will offer economically displaced persons options for alternative income earning opportunities, such as credit facilities, skills training, business start-up assistance, employment opportunities, or cash assistance additional to compensation for assets. Cash assistance alone, however, frequently fails to provide affected persons with the productive means or skills to restore livelihoods. Transitional support will be provided as necessary to all economically displaced persons, based on a reasonable estimate of the time required to restore their income-earning capacity, production levels, and standards of living. c. collaboration with other responsible agencies or subnational jurisdictions The Borrower will establish means of collaboration between the agency or entity responsible for project implementation and any other governmental agencies, subnational jurisdictions or entities that are responsible for any aspects of land acquisition, resettlement planning, or provision of necessary assistance. In addition, where the capacity of other responsible agencies is limited, the Borrower will actively support resettlement planning, implementation, and monitoring. If the procedures or standards of other responsible agencies do not meet the relevant requirements of this , the Borrower will prepare supplemental arrangements or provisions for inclusion in the resettlement plan to address identified shortcomings. The plan will also specify financial responsibilities for each of the agencies involved, appropriate timing and sequencing for implementation steps, and coordination arrangements for addressing financial contingencies or responding to unforeseen circumstances. d. technical and financial assistance The Borrower may request technical assistance from the Bank to strengthen Borrower capacity, or the capacity of other responsible agencies, for resettlement planning, implementation and monitoring. Such forms of assistance may include staff training, assistance in formulating new regulations or policies relating to land acquisition or other aspects of resettlement, financing for assessments or other investment costs associated with physical or economic displacement, or other purposes. The Borrower may request the Bank to finance either a component of the main investment causing displacement and requiring resettlement, or a free-standing resettlement project with appropriate cross-conditionalities, processed and implemented in parallel with the investment that causes the displacement. The Borrower may also request the Bank to finance resettlement even though it is not financing the main investment that makes resettlement necessary. involuntary resettlement This Annex describes the elements of the plans physical and or economic displacement in paragraph of . For purposes this Annex, these plans shall be referred to as plans.\u201d Resettlement plans include to address physical and or economic disdepending on the nature of the impacts from a project. Projects may use alternanomenclature, depending on the scope of the plan\u2014for example, where a project only economic displacement, the reset plan may be called a \u201clivelihood plan\u201d or restrictions on access to legally designated and protected areas are involved, the plan take the form of a \u201cprocess framework.\u201d This also describes the framework referred to in of . resettlement plan The scope of requirements and level of detail the resettlement plan vary with the magnitude complexity of resettlement. The plan is based up-to-date and reliable information about proposed proect and its potential impacts the displaced persons and other adversely groups, appropriate and feasible mitimeasures, and the legal and institutional required for effective implementation resettlement measures. elements of a resettlement plan Description of the project. General description of project and identification of the project area. Potential impacts. Identification of: the project components or activities that give rise to displacement, explaining why the selected land must be acquired for use within the time frame of the project; the zone of impact of such components or activities; the scope and scale of land acquisition and impacts on structures and other fixed assets; any project-imposed restrictions on use of, or access to, land or natural resources; alternatives considered to avoid or minimize displacement and why those were rejected; and the mechanisms established to minimize displacement, to the extent possible, during project implementation. Objectives. The main objectives of the resettlement program. Census survey and baseline socioeconomic studies. The findings of a household-level census identifying and enumerating affected persons, and, with the involvement of affected persons, surveying land, structures and other fixed assets to be affected by the project. The census survey also serves other essential functions: identifying characteristics of displaced households, including a description of production systems, labor, and household organization; and baseline information on livelihoods and standards of living of the displaced population; information on vulnerable groups or persons for whom special provisions may have to be made; identifying public or community infrastructure, property or services that may be affected; providing a basis for the design of, and budgeting for, the resettlement program; in conjunction with establishment of a cutoff date, providing a basis for excluding ineligible people from compensation and resettlement assistance; and establishing baseline conditions for monitoring and evaluation purposes. As the Bank may deem relevant, additional studies on the following subjects may be required to supplement or inform the census survey: land tenure and transfer systems, including an inventory of common property natural resources from which people derive their livelihoods and sustenance, non-title-based usufruct systems governed by local recognized land allocation mechanisms, and any issues raised by different tenure systems in the project area; the patterns of social interaction in the affected communities, including social networks and social support systems, and how they will be affected by the project; and social and cultural characteristics of displaced communities, including a description of formal and informal institutions ) that may be relevant to the consultation strategy and to designing and implementing the resettlement activities. Legal framework. The findings of an analysis of legal framework, covering: the scope of the power of compulsory acquisition and imposition of land use restriction and the nature of compensation associated with it, in terms of both the valuation methodology and the timing of payment; the applicable legal and administrative procedures, including a description of the remedies available to displaced persons in the judicial process and the normal time frame for such procedures, and any available grievance redress mechanisms that may be relevant to the project; laws and regulations relating to the agencies responsible for implementing resettlement activities; and gaps, if any, between local laws and practices covering compulsory acquisition, imposition of land use restrictions and provision of resettlement measures and , and the mechanisms to bridge such gaps. Institutional framework. The findings of an analyof the institutional framework covering: the identification of agencies responsible for resettlement activities and that may have a role in project implementation, including providing support for displaced persons; an assessment of the institutional capacity of such agencies and ; and any steps that are proposed to enhance the institutional capacity of agencies and responsible for resettlement implementation. Eligibility. Definition of displaced persons and for determining their eligibility for compenand other resettlement assistance, including cutoff dates. Valuation of and compensation for losses. The to be used in valuing losses to deter their replacement cost; and a description of proposed types and levels of compensation for natural resources and other assets under local and such supplementary measures as are necto achieve replacement cost for them. Community participation. Involvement of dispersons a summary of the views expressed and how these views were taken into account in preparing the resettlement plan; a review of the resettlement alternatives presented and the choices made by displaced persons regarding options available to them; and institutionalized arrangements by which displaced people can communicate their concerns to project authorities throughout planning and implementation, and measures to ensure that such vulnerable groups as indigenous people, ethnic minorities, the landless, and women are adequately represented. Implementation schedule. An implementation schedule providing anticipated dates for displacement, and estimated initiation and completion dates for all resettlement plan activities. The schedule should indicate how the resettlement activities are linked to the implementation of the overall project. Costs and budget. Tables showing categorized cost estimates for all resettlement activities, including allowances for inflation, population growth, and other contingencies; timetables for expenditures; sources of funds; and arrangements for timely flow of funds, and funding for resettlement, if any, in areas outside the jurisdiction of the implementing agencies. Grievance redress mechanism. The plan describes affordable and accessible procedures for third-party settlement of disputes arising from displacement or resettlement; such grievance mechanisms should take into account the availability of judicial recourse and community and traditional dispute settlement mechanisms. Monitoring and evaluation. Arrangements for monitoring of displacement and resettlement activities by the implementing agency, supplemented by third-party monitors as considered appropriate by the Bank, to ensure complete and objective information; performance monitoring indicators to measure inputs, outputs, and outcomes for resettlement activities; involvement of the displaced persons in the monitoring process; evaluation of results for a reasonable period after all resettlement activities have been completed; using the results of resettlement monitoring to guide subsequent implementation. Arrangements for adaptive management. The plan should include provisions for adapting resettlement implementation in response to unanticipated changes in project conditions, or unanticipated obstacles to achieving satisfactory resettlement outcomes. planning requirements where involves physical displacement When project circumstances require the physical of residents , resettlement require additional information and planning Additional requirements include: Transitional assistance. The plan describes to be provided for relocation of house members and their possessions . The plan describes any assistance to be provided for households cash compensation and securing their own housing, including construction of new If planned relocation sites are not ready for occupancy at the of physical displacement, the plan establishes transitional allowance sufficient to meet tempo rental expenses and other costs until occuis available. Site selection, site preparation, and relocation. planned relocation sites are to be prepared, resettlement plan describes the alternative relosites considered and explains sites selected, institutional and technical arrangements for identifying and preparing relocation sites, whether rural or urban, for which a combination of productive potential, locational advantages, and other factors is better or at least comparable to the advantages of the old sites, with an estimate of the time needed to acquire and transfer land and ancillary resources; identification and consideration of opportunities to improve local living standards by supplemental investment in infrastructure, facilities or services; any measures necessary to prevent land speculation or influx of ineligible persons at the selected sites; procedures for physical relocation under the project, including timetables for site preparation and transfer; and legal arrangements for regularizing tenure and transferring titles to those resettled, including provision of security of tenure for those previously lacking full legal rights to land or structures.

Environmental protection and management. Adescription of the boundaries of the planned relocation sites; and an assessment of the environmental impacts of the proposed resettlement and measures to mitigate and manage these impacts . Consultation on relocation arrangements. The plan describes methods of consultation with physically displaced persons on their preferences regarding relocation alternatives available to them, including, as relevant, choices related to forms of compensation and transitional assistance, to relocating as individual households families or with preexisting communities or kinship groups, to sustaining existing patterns of group organization, and for relocation of, or retaining access to, cultural property . Integration with host populations. Measures to mitigate the impact of planned relocation sites on any host communities, including: consultations with host communities and local governments; arrangements for prompt tendering of any payment due the hosts for land or other assets provided in support of planned relocation sites; arrangements for identifying and addressing any conflict that may arise between those resettled and host communities; and any measures necessary to augment services in host communities to meet increased demands upon them, or to make them at least comparable to services available within planned relocation sites. Additional planning requirements where resettlement involves economic displacement If land acquisition or restrictions on use of, or access to, land or natural resources may cause significant economic displacement, arrangements to provide displaced persons with sufficient opportunity to improve, or at least restore, their livelihoods are also incorporated into the resettlement plan, or into a separate livelihoods improvement plan. These include: Direct land replacement. For those with agricultural livelihoods, the resettlement plan provides for an option to receive replacement land of equivalent productive value, or demonstrates that sufficient of equivalent value is unavailable. Where land is available, the plan describes and timing for its allocation to displaced Loss of access to land or resources. For those livelihood is affected by loss of land or use or access, including common property the resettlement plan describes means to substitutes or alternative resources, or othprovides support for alternative livelihoods. Support for alternative livelihoods. For all other of economically displaced persons, the plan describes feasible arrangements obtaining employment or for establishing a busiincluding provision of relevant supplemental including skills training, credit, licenses permits, or specialized equipment. As warranted, planning provides special assistance to minorities or vulnerable groups who may be in securing alternative livelihoods. Consideration of economic development oppor The resettlement plan identifies and any feasible opportunities to promote livelihoods as a result of resettlement This may include, for example, preferenproject employment arrangements, support for of specialized products or markets, commercial zoning and trading arrangeor other measures. Where relevant, the plan also assess the feasibility of prospects for distributions to communities, or directly to persons, through establishment of benefit-sharing arrangements. Transitional support. The resettlement plan transitional support to those whose liveliwill be disrupted. This may include payment lost crops and lost natural resources, payment of profits for businesses, or payment of lost wages employees affected by business relocation. The provides that the transitional support continfor the duration of the transition period. resettlement framework The purpose of the resettlement framework is clarify resettlement principles, organizational and design criteria to be applied subprojects or project components to be preduring project implementation . Once the subproject or individual project are defined and the necessary inforbecomes available, such a framework will expanded into a specific plan proportionate to risks and impacts. Project activities that cause physical and or economic displacement not commence until such specific plans have finalized and approved by the Bank. The resettlement policy framework covers the following elements: a brief description of the project and components for which land acquisition and resettlement are required, and an explanation of why a resettlement policy framework rather than a resettlement plan is being prepared; principles and objectives governing resettlement preparation and implementation; a description of the process for preparing and approving resettlement plans; estimated displacement impacts and estimated numbers and categories of displaced persons, to the extent feasible; eligibility criteria for defining various categories of displaced persons; a legal framework reviewing the fit between borrower laws and regulations and Bank policy requirements and measures proposed to bridge any gaps between them; methods of valuing affected assets; organizational procedures for delivery of compensation and other resettlement assistance, including, for projects involving private sector intermediaries, the responsibilities of the financial intermediary, the government, and the private developer; a description of the implementation process, linking resettlement implementation to civil works; a description of grievance redress mechanisms; a description of the arrangements for funding resettlement, including the preparation and review of cost estimates, the flow of funds, and contingency arrangements; a description of mechanisms for consultations with, and participation of, displaced persons in planning, implementation, and monitoring; and arrangements for monitoring by the implementing agency and, if required, by third-party monitors. c. Process framework Aprocess framework is prepared when Bank supported projects may cause restrictions in access to natural resources in legally designated parks and protected areas. The purpose of the process framework is to establish a process by which members of potentially affected communities participate in design of project components, determination of measures necessary to achieve the objectives of this , and implementation and monitoring of relevant project activities. Specifically, the process framework describes processes by which the following will be accomplished: Project components will be prepared and implemented. The document should briefly describe the project and components or activities that may involve new or more stringent restrictions on natural resource use. It should also describe the process by which potentially displaced persons participate in project design. Criteria for eligibility of affected persons will be determined. The document should establish that potentially affected communities will be involved in identifying any adverse impacts, assessing of the significance of impacts, and establishing of the criteria for eligibility for any mitigating or compensating measures necessary. Measures to assist affected persons in their efforts to improve their livelihoods or restore them, in real terms, to pre-displacement levels, while maintaining the sustainability of the park or protected area will be identified. The document should describe methods and procedures by which communities will identify and choose potential mitigating or compensating measures to be provided to those adversely affected, and procedures by which adversely affected community members will decide among the options available to them. Potential conflicts or grievances within or between affected communities will be resolved. The document should describe the process for resolving disputes relating to resource use restrictions that may arise between or among affected communities, and grievances that may arise from members of communities who are dissatisfied with the eligibility criteria, community planning measures, or actual implementation. the process framework should describe relating to the following: Administrative and legal procedures. The document should review agreements reached regarding the process approach with relevant administrative jurisdictions and line ministries . Monitoring arrangements. The document should review arrangements for participatory monitoring of project activities as they relate to impacts on persons within the project impact area, and for monitoring the effectiveness of measures taken to improve incomes, livelihoods and living standards. biodiversity Conservation and sustainable of living natural",
    "text_america":"introduction recognizes that project-related land acquisition and restrictions on land use can have adverse impacts on communities and persons. Project-related land acquisition or restrictions on land use may cause physical displacement , economic displacement , or both. The term \u201cinvoluntary resettlement\u201d refers to these impacts. Resettlement is considered involuntary when affected persons or communities do not have the right to refuse land acquisition or restrictions on land use that result in displacement. \u201cLand acquisition\u201d refers to all methods of obtaining land for project purposes, which may include outright purchase, expropriation of property and acquisition of access rights, such as easements or rights of way. Land acquisition may also include: aacuisition of unoccupied or unutilied land whether or not the landholder relies upon such land for income or livelihood purposes; repossession of public land that is used or occupied by individuals or households; and project impacts that result in land being submerged or otherwise rendered unusable or inaccessible. \u201cLand\u201d includes anything growing on or permanently affixed to land, such as crops, buildings and other improvements, and appurtenant water bodies. 2\u201c Restrictions on land use\u201d refers to limitations or prohibitions on the use of agricultural, residential, commercial or other land that are directly introduced and put into effect as part of the project. These may include restrictions on access to legally designated parks and protected areas, restrictions on access to other common property resources, and restrictions on land use within utility easements or safety zones. \u201cLivelihood\u201d refers to the full range of means that individuals, families and communities utilize to make a living, such as wage-based income, agriculture, fishing, foraging, other natural resource-based livelihoods, petty trade and bartering. restrictions involuntary Experience and research indicate that physical economic displacement, if unmitigated, may rise to severe economic, social and environrisks: production systems may be dismanpeople face impoverishment if their productive or other income sources are lost; people be relocated to environments where their pros kills are less applicable and the competi- . for resources greater; community institutions social networks may be weakened; kin groups be dispersed; and cultural identity, traditional and the potential for mutual help may diminished or lost. For these reasons, involresettlement should be avoided. Where resettlement is unavoidable, it will be and appropriate measures to mitigate impacts on displaced persons will be planned and implemented. To avoid involuntary resettlement or, when unavoidable, minimize involuntary resettlement by exploring project design alternatives. To avoid forced eviction. To mitigate unavoidable adverse social and economic impacts from land acquisition or restrictions on land use by: a providing timely compensation for loss of assets at replacement voidance is the preferred approach in accordance with the hierarchy in . It is especially important to avoid or economic displacement of those socially or ecovulnerable to hardship as a result. However, avoid may not be the preferred approach in situations where health or safety would be adversely affected as a result. may also be situations where resettlement can provide development opportunities for households or communiincluding improved housing and public health conditions, security of tenure or other improvements to local standards. See paragraph cost and bassi sting displaced persons in their efforts to improve, or at least restore, their livelihoods and living standards, in real terms, to pre-displacement levels or to levels prevailing prior to the beginning of project implementation, whichever is higher. To improve living conditions of poor or vulnerable persons who are physically displaced, through provision of adequate housing, access to services and facilities, and security of tenure. To conceive and execute resettlement activities as sustainable development programs, providing sufficient investment resources to enable displaced persons to benefit directly from the project, as the nature of the project may warrant. To ensure that resettlement activities are planned and implemented with appropriate disclosure of information, meaningful consultation, and the informed participation of those affected. Scope of application The applicability of is established during the described in . This applies to permanent or temporary physical and economic displacement resulting from the following types of land acquisition or restrictions on \u201cReplacement cost\u201d is defined as a method of valuation yielding compensation sufficient to replace assets, plus necessary transaction costs associated with asset replacement. Where functioning markets exist, replacement cost is the market value as established through independent and competent real estate valuation, plus transaction costs. Where functioning markets do not exist, replacement cost may be determined through alternative means, such as calculation of output value for land or productive assets, or the undepreciated value of replacement material and labor for construction of structures or other fixed assets, plus transaction costs. In all instances where physical displacement results in loss of shelter, replacement cost must at least be sufficient to enable purchase or construction of housing that meets acceptable minimum community standards of quality and safety. The valuation method for determining replacement cost should be documented and included in relevant resettlement planning documents. Transaction costs include administrative charges, registration or title fees, reasonable moving expenses, and any similar costs imposed on affected persons. To ensure compensation at replacement cost, planned compensation rates may require updating in project areas where inflation is high or the period of time between calculation of compensation rates and delivery of compensation is extensive. 7\u201c Security of tenure\u201d means that resettled individuals or communities are resettled to a site that they can legally occupy, where they are protected from the risk of eviction and where the tenure rights provided to them are socially and culturally appropriate. In no event will resettled persons be provided tenure rights that are in effect weaker than the rights they had to the land or assets from which they have been displaced. use undertaken or imposed in connection with implementation: Land rights or land use rights acquired or restricted through expropriation or other compulsory procedures in accordance with national law; Land rights or land use rights acquired or restricted through negotiated settlements with property owners or those with legal rights to the land, if failure to reach settlement would have resulted in expropriation or other compulsory procedures; Restrictions on land use and access to natural resources that cause a community or groups within a community to lose access to resource usage where they have traditional or customary tenure, or recognizable usage rights. This may include situations where legally designated protected areas, forests, biodiversity areas or buffer zones are established in connection with the project; Relocation of people without formal, traditional, or recognizable usage rights, who are occupying or utilizing land prior to a project specific cut-off date; Displacement of people as a result of project impacts that render their land unusable or inaccessible; Restriction on access to land or use of other resources including communal property and natural resources such as marine and aquatic resources, timber and non-timber forest products, freshwater, medicinal plants, hunting and gathering grounds and grazing and cropping areas; Notwithstanding the application of this to such situations, Borrower is encouraged to seek negotiated settlements with persons in a manner meeting the requirements of this in order to help avoid administrative or judicial delays associated with formal expropriation, and to the extent possible to the impacts on affected persons associated with formal such situations, affected persons frequently do not have forownership. This may include freshwater and marine environ This does not apply to restrictions of access to natural under community-based natural resource manageprojects, i.e., where the community using the resources coldecides to restrict access to these resources, provided an assessment satisfactory to the Bank establishes that the decision-making process is adequate and reflects informed consensus, and that appropriate measures been agreed and put in place to mitigate adverse impacts, if on the vulnerable members of the community. Land rights or claims to land or resources relinquished by individuals or communities without full payment of compensation; and Land acquisition or land use restrictions occurring prior to the project, but which were undertaken or initiated in anticipation of, or in preparation for, the project. This does not apply to impacts on incomes or livelihoods that are not a direct result of land acquisition or land use restrictions imposed by the project. Such impacts will be addressed in accordance with . This does not apply to voluntary, legally recorded market transactions in which the seller is given a genuine opportunity to retain the land and to refuse to sell it, and is fully informed about available choices and their implications. However, where such voluntary land transactions may result in the displacement of persons, other than the seller, who occupy, use or claim rights to the land in question, this will apply. Where a project supports land titling or other activities intended to confirm, regularize or determine land rights, a social, legal and institutional In some circumstances, it may be proposed that part or all of the land to be used by the project is donated on a voluntary basis without payment of full compensation. Subject to prior Bank approval, this may be acceptable providing the Borrower demonstrates that: the potential donor or donors have been appropriately informed and consulted about the project and the choices available to them; potential donors are aware that refusal is an option, and have confirmed in writing their willingness to proceed with the donation; the amount of land being donated is minor and will not reduce the donor\u2019s remaining land area below that required to maintain the donor\u2019s livelihood at current levels; no household relocation is involved; the donor is expected to benefit directly from the project; and for community or collective land, donation can only occur with the consent of individuals using or occupying the land. The Borrower will maintain a transparent record of all consultations and agreements reached. This may include situations where a project supports voluntary transactions between communities, governments and investors involving significant areas of land . In such cases, in applying the relevant provisions of this , special care must be taken to ensure: a that all tenure rights and claims affecting the land in question are systematically and impartially identified; that potentially affected individuals, groups or communities are meaningfully consulted, informed of their rights, and provided reliable information concerning environmental, economic, social and food security impacts of the proposed investment; that community stakeholders are enabled to negotiate fair value and appropriate conditions for the transfer; that appropriate compensation, benefit sharing and grievance redress mechanisms are put in place; that terms and conditions of the transfer are transparent; and mechanisms are put in place for monitoring compliance with those terms and conditions. will be required under .

General classification Affected persons may be classified as persons: Who have formal legal rights to land or assets; Who do not have formal legal rights to land or assets, but have a claim to land or assets that is recognized or recognizable under national law; or Who have no recognizable legal right or claim to the land or assets they occupy or use. census described in paragraph will establish status of the affected persons. , para. See , footnote. Such claims could be derived from adverse possession or from or traditional tenure arrangements. Project design The Borrower will demonstrate that involuntary land acquisition or restrictions on land use are limited to direct project requirements for clearly specified project purposes within a clearly specified period of time. The Borrower will consider feasible alternative project designs to avoid or minimize land acquisition or restrictions on land use, especially where this would result in physical or economic displacement, while balancing environmental, social, and financial costs and benefits, and paying particular attention to gender impacts and impacts on the poor and vulnerable. Compensation and benefits for affected persons When land acquisition or restrictions on land use cannot be avoided, the Borrower will offer affected persons compensation at replacement cost, and other assistance as may be necessary to help them improve or at least restore their standards of living or livelihoods, subect to the proisions of paragraph through of this . Compensation standards for categories of land and fixed assets will be disclosed and applied consistently. Compensation rates may be subject to upward adjustment where negotiation strategies are employed. In all cases, a clear basis for calculation of compensation will be documented, and compensation distributed in accordance with transparent procedures. Where livelihoods of displaced persons are land-based, or where land is collectively owned, the Borrower will offer the displaced persons an option for replacement land in accordance with paragraph 3, unless it can be demonstrated to the Bank\u2019s satisfaction that equivalent replacement land is unavailable. As the nature and objectives of the project may allow, the Borrower will also provide opportunities to displaced communities and persons to derive appropriate development benefits from the project. In the case of affected persons under paragraph , resettlement assistance will be provided in lieu of compensation for land, as described in paragraphs and . The Borrower will take possession of acquired land and related assets only after compensation in accordance with this has been made available At the request of affected persons, it may be necessary to acquire entire land parcels if partial acquisition would render the remainder economically unviable, or make the remaining parcel unsafe or inaccessible for human use or occupancy. The term \u201cland-based\u201d includes livelihood activities such as rotational cropping and grazing of livestock as well as the harvesting of natural resources. where applicable, displaced people have been and moving allowances have been proto the displaced persons in addition to compensation In addition, livelihood restoration and programs will commence in a timely in order to ensure that affected persons are prepared to take advantage of alternative livelihood opportunities as the need to do so In certain cases there may be significant difrelated to the payment of compensation particular affected persons, for example, where efforts to contact absentee owners have where project-affected persons have rejected that has been offered to them in with the approved plan, or where comclaims to the ownership of lands or assets are to lengthy legal proceedings. On an excepbasis, with prior agreement of the Bank, and the Borrower demonstrates that all reason efforts to resolve such matters have been taken, Borrower may deposit compensation funds as by the plan into an interest-bearing or other deposit account and proceed with relevant project activities. Compensation placed escrow will be made available to eligible persons a timely manner as issues are resolved. engagement The Borrower will engage with affected comincluding host communities, through process of stakeholder engagement described . Decision-making processes related to and livelihood restoration will include and alternatives from which affected permay choose. Disclosure of relevant information meaningful participation of affected community and persons will take place during the considof alternative project designs referred to in 1, and thereafter throughout the planimplementation, monitoring, and evaluation the compensation process, livelihood restoration and relocation process. Additional proviapply to consultations with displaced Indig Peoples, in accordance with . The consultation process should ensure that perspectives are obtained and their inter factored into all aspects of resettlement plan and implementation. Addressing livelihood may require intra-household analysis in where women\u2019s and men\u2019s livelihoods are differently. Women\u2019s and men\u2019s preferin terms of compensation mechanisms, such replacement land or alternative access to natural rather than in cash, should be explored. Grievance mechanism The Borrower will ensure that a grievance mechanism for the project is in place, in accordance with as early as possible in project development to address specific concerns about compensation, relocation or livelihood restoration measures raised by displaced persons in a timely fashion. Where possible, such grievance mechanisms will utilize existing formal or informal grievance mechanisms suitable for project purposes, supplemented as needed with project-specific arrangements designed to resolve disputes in an impartial manner. Planning and implementation Where land acquisition or restrictions on land use are unavoidable, the Borrower will, as part of the , conduct a census to identify the persons who will be affected by the project, to establish an inventory of land and assets to be affected, to determine who will be eligible for compensation and assistance, and to discourage ineligible persons, such as opportunistic settlers, from claiming benefits. The social assessment will also address the claims of communities or groups who, for valid reasons, may not be present in the project area during the time of the census, such as seasonal resource users. In conjunction with the census, the Borrower will establish a cutoff date for eligibility. Information regarding the cut-off date will be well documented and will be disseminated throughout the project area at regular intervals in written and nonwritten forms and in relevant local languages. This will include posted warnings that persons settling in the project area after the cutoff date may be subject to removal. To address the issues identified in the , the Borrower will prepare a plan proportionate to the risks and impacts associated with the project: For projects with minor land acquisition or restrictions on land use, as a result of which there will be no significant impact on incomes See Annex Such inventory should include a detailed account, derived through a consultative, impartial and transparent process, of the full range of rights held or asserted by affected people, including those based on custom or practice, secondary rights such as rights of access or use for livelihoods purposes, rights held in common, etc. Documentation of ownership or occupancy and compensation payments should be issued in the names of both spouses or single heads of households as relevant, and other resettlement assistance, such as skills training, access to credit, and job opportunities, should be equally available to women and adapted to their needs. Where national law and tenure systems do not recognize the rights of women to hold or contract in property, measures should be considered to provide women as much protection as possible with the objective to achieve equity with men. See Annex or livelihoods, the plan will establish eligibility criteria for affected persons, set out procedures and standards for compensation, and incorporate arrangements for consultations, monitoring and addressing grievances; For projects causing physical displacement, the plan will set out the additional measures relevant to relocation of affected persons; For projects involving economic displacement with significant impacts on livelihoods or income generation, the plan will set out the additional measures relating to livelihood improvement or restoration; and For projects that may impose changes in land use that restrict access to resources in legally designated parks or protected areas or other common property resources on which local people may depend for livelihood purposes, the plan will establish a participatory process for determining appropriate restrictions on use and set out the mitigation measures to address adverse impacts on livelihoods that may result from such restrictions. The Borrower\u2019s plan will establish the roles and relating to financing and implemenand include arrangements for contingency to meet unanticipated costs, as well as for timely and coordinated response unforeseen circumstances impeding progress desired outcomes. The full costs of reset activities necessary to achieve the objecof the project are included in the total costs of project. The costs of resettlement, like the costs other project activities, are treated as a charge the economic benefits of the project; and net benefits to resettlers are added to the stream of the project. The Borrower will establish procedures to moniand evaluate the implementation of the plan will take corrective action as necessary during to achieve the objectives of this The extent of monitoring activities will be proto the project\u2019s risks and impacts. For all with significant involuntary resettlement the Borrower will retain competent reset professionals to monitor the implementaof resettlement plans, design corrective actions necessary, provide advice on compliance with and produce periodic monitoring reports. persons will be consulted during the moniprocess. Periodic monitoring reports will be or projects with significant resettlement impacts and complex measures, the Borrower may consider preparing a resettlement project for Bank support. prepared and affected persons will be informed about monitoring results in a timely manner. Implementation of the Borrower\u2019s plan will be considered completed when the adverse impacts of resettlement have been addressed in a manner that is consistent with the relevant plan as well as the objectives of this . For all projects with significant involuntary resettlement impacts, the Borrower will commission an external completion audit of the plan when all mitigation measures have been substantially completed. The completion audit will be undertaken by competent resettlement professionals, will assess whether livelihoods and living standards have been improved or at least restored and, as necessary, will propose corrective actions to meet objectives not yet achieved. Where the likely nature or magnitude of the land acquisition or restrictions on land use related to a project with potential to cause physical and or economic displacement is unknown during project preparation, the Borrower will develop a framework establishing general principles and procedures compatible with this . Once the individual project components are defined and the necessary information becomes available, such a framework will be expanded into one or more specific plans proportionate to potential risks and impacts. No physical and or economic displacement will occur until plans required by this have been finalized and approved by the Bank. B. displacement Physical displacement In the case of physical displacement, the Borrower will develop a plan that covers, at a minimum, the applicable requirements of this regardless of the number of people affected. The plan will be designed to mitigate the negative impacts of displacement and, as warranted, to identify development opportunities. It will include a resettlement budget and implementation schedule, and establish the entitlements of all categories of affected persons . Particular attention will be paid to gender aspects and the needs of the poor and the vulnerable. The Borrower will document all transactions to acquire land rights, provision of compensation and other assistance associated with relocation activities. If people living in the project area are required to move to another location, the Borrower will: aoffer displaced persons choices among feasible resettlement options, including adequate replacement housing or cash compensation; and provide relocation assistance suited to the needs of each group of displaced persons. New resettlement sites will offer living conditions at least equivalent those previously enjoyed, or consistent with preminimum codes or standards, whichever set standards is higher. If new resettlement sites are be prepared, host communities will be consulted planning options, and resettlement plans ensure continued access, at least at existing levor standards, for host communities to facilities services. The displaced persons\u2019 preferences respect to relocating in preexisting community and groups will be respected wherever possible. social and cultural institutions of the dispersons and any host communities will be In the case of physically displaced persons under or , the Borrower will offer the of replacement property of equal or higher with security of tenure, equivalent or better and advantages of location, or cash at replacement cost. Compensation kind should be considered in lieu of cash. In the case of physically displaced persons under , the Borrower will provide arrangement to allow them to obtain adequate housing security of tenure. Where these displaced perown structures, the Borrower will compensate for the loss of assets other than land, such dwellings and other improvements to the land, replacement cost. Based on consultation with displaced persons, the Borrower will provide assistance in lieu of compensation for sufficient for them to restore their standards living at an adequate alternative site. The Borrower is not required to compensate or those who encroach on the project area after cutoff date for eligibility, provided the cut-off has been clearly established and made public. payment of cash compensation for lost land and other assets be appropriate where: livelihoods are not land-based; are land based but the land taken for the proect a small fraction of the affected asset and the residual land economically viable; or active markets for land, housing, labor exist, displaced persons use such markets, there is supply of land and housing, and the Borrower has to the satisfaction of the Bank that insufficient land is available. here the Borrower demonstrates that an affected person substantial income from multiple illegal rental units, compensation and other assistance that would otherwise available to such person for non-land assets and livelihood under this paragraph may be reduced with the prior of the Bank, to better reflect the objectives of this . elocation of informal settlers in urban areas may involve For example, the relocated families may gain secuof tenure, but they may lose locational advantages that may essential to livelihoods, especially among the poor or vulner Changes in location that may affect livelihood opportunities be addressed in accordance with the relevant provisions this ). The Borrower will not resort to forced evictions of affected persons. \u201cForced eviction\u201d is defined as the permanent or temporary removal against the will of individuals, families, and or communities from the homes and or land which they occupy without the provision of, and access to, appropriate forms of legal and other protection, including all applicable procedures and principles in this . The exercise of eminent domain, compulsory acquisition or similar powers by a Borrower will not be considered to be forced eviction providing it complies with the requirements of national law and the provisions of this , and is conducted in a manner consistent with basic principles of due process . As an alternative to displacement, the Borrower may consider negotiating in situ land development arrangements by which those to be affected may elect to accept a partial loss of land or localized relocation in return for improvements that will increase the value of their property after development. Any person not wishing to participate will be allowed to opt instead for full compensation and other assistance as required in this . Economic displacement In the case of projects affecting livelihoods or income generation, the Borrower\u2019s plan will include measures to allow affected persons to improve, or at least restore, their incomes or livelihoods. The plan will establish the entitlements of affected persons and or communities, paying particular attention to gender aspects and the needs of vulnerable segments of communities, and will ensure that these are provided in a transparent, consistent, and equitable manner. The plan will incorporate arrangements to monitor the effectiveness of livelihood measures during implementation, as well as evaluation once implementation is completed. The mitigation of economic displacement will be considered complete when the completion audit concludes that affected persons or communities have received all of the assistance for which they are eligible, and have been provided with adequate opportunity to reestablish their livelihoods. Economically displaced persons who face loss of assets or access to assets will be compensated for such loss at replacement cost: In cases where land acquisition or restrictions on land use affect commercial enterprises, This includes shops, restaurants, services, manufacturing facilities and other enterprises, regardless of size and whether licensed or unlicensed. affected business owners will be compensated for the cost of identifying a viable alternative location; for lost net income during the period of transition; for the cost of the transfer and reinstallation of the plant, machinery, or other equipment; and for reestablishing commercial activities. Affected employees will receive assistance for temporary loss of wages and, if necessary, assistance in identifying alternative employment opportunities; In cases affecting persons with legal rights or claims to land that are recognized or recognizable under national law and ), replacement property of equal or greater value will be provided, or, where appropriate, cash compensation at replacement cost; and Economically displaced persons who are without legally recognizable claims to land , at replacement cost. Additionally, the Borrower will provide assistance in lieu of land compensation sufficient to provide such persons with an opportunity to reestablish livelihoods elsewhere. The Borrower is not required to compensate or assist persons who encroach on the project area after the cutoff date for eligibility. Economically displaced persons will be proopportunities to improve, or at least restore, means of income-earning capacity, production and standards of living: For persons whose livelihoods are land-based, replacement land that has a combination of productive potential, locational advantages, and other factors at least equivalent to that being lost will be offered where feasible; For persons whose livelihoods are natural resource-based and where project-related restrictions on access envisaged in paragraph apply, measures will be implemented to either allow continued access to affected resources or to provide access to alternative resources with equivalent livelihood-earning potential and accessibility. Where common property resources are affected, benefits and compensation associated with restrictions on natural resource usage may be collective in nature; and If it is demonstrated that replacement land or resources are unavailable, the Borrower will offer economically displaced persons options for alternative income earning opportunities, such as credit facilities, skills training, business start-up assistance, employment opportunities, or cash assistance additional to compensation for assets. Cash assistance alone, however, frequently fails to provide affected persons with the productive means or skills to restore livelihoods. Transitional support will be provided as necessary to all economically displaced persons, based on a reasonable estimate of the time required to restore their income-earning capacity, production levels, and standards of living. c. collaboration with other responsible agencies or subnational jurisdictions The Borrower will establish means of collaboration between the agency or entity responsible for project implementation and any other governmental agencies, subnational jurisdictions or entities that are responsible for any aspects of land acquisition, resettlement planning, or provision of necessary assistance. In addition, where the capacity of other responsible agencies is limited, the Borrower will actively support resettlement planning, implementation, and monitoring. If the procedures or standards of other responsible agencies do not meet the relevant requirements of this , the Borrower will prepare supplemental arrangements or provisions for inclusion in the resettlement plan to address identified shortcomings. The plan will also specify financial responsibilities for each of the agencies involved, appropriate timing and sequencing for implementation steps, and coordination arrangements for addressing financial contingencies or responding to unforeseen circumstances. d. technical and financial assistance The Borrower may request technical assistance from the Bank to strengthen Borrower capacity, or the capacity of other responsible agencies, for resettlement planning, implementation and monitoring. Such forms of assistance may include staff training, assistance in formulating new regulations or policies relating to land acquisition or other aspects of resettlement, financing for assessments or other investment costs associated with physical or economic displacement, or other purposes. The Borrower may request the Bank to finance either a component of the main investment causing displacement and requiring resettlement, or a free-standing resettlement project with appropriate cross-conditionalities, processed and implemented in parallel with the investment that causes the displacement. The Borrower may also request the Bank to finance resettlement even though it is not financing the main investment that makes resettlement necessary. involuntary resettlement This Annex describes the elements of the plans physical and or economic displacement in paragraph of . For purposes this Annex, these plans shall be referred to as plans.\u201d Resettlement plans include to address physical and or economic disdepending on the nature of the impacts from a project. Projects may use alternative nomenclature, depending on the scope of the plan\u2014for example, where a project only economic displacement, the reset plan may be called a \u201clivelihood plan\u201d or restrictions on access to legally designated and protected areas are involved, the plan take the form of a \u201cprocess framework.\u201d This also describes the framework referred to in of . resettlement plan The scope of requirements and level of detail the resettlement plan vary with the magnitude complexity of resettlement. The plan is based up-to-date and reliable information about proposed proect and its potential impacts the displaced persons and other adversely groups, appropriate and feasible mitimeasures, and the legal and institutional required for effective implementation resettlement measures. elements of a resettlement plan Description of the project. General description of project and identification of the project area. Potential impacts. Identification of: the project components or activities that give rise to displacement, explaining why the selected land must be acquired for use within the time frame of the project; the zone of impact of such components or activities; the scope and scale of land acquisition and impacts on structures and other fixed assets; any project-imposed restrictions on use of, or access to, land or natural resources; alternatives considered to avoid or minimize displacement and why those were rejected; and the mechanisms established to minimize displacement, to the extent possible, during project implementation. Objectives. The main objectives of the resettlement program. Census survey and baseline socioeconomic studies. The findings of a household-level census identifying and enumerating affected persons, and, with the involvement of affected persons, surveying land, structures and other fixed assets to be affected by the project. The census survey also serves other essential functions: identifying characteristics of displaced households, including a description of production systems, labor, and household organization; and baseline information on livelihoods and standards of living of the displaced population; information on vulnerable groups or persons for whom special provisions may have to be made; identifying public or community infrastructure, property or services that may be affected; providing a basis for the design of, and budgeting for, the resettlement program; in conjunction with establishment of a cutoff date, providing a basis for excluding ineligible people from compensation and resettlement assistance; and establishing baseline conditions for monitoring and evaluation purposes. As the Bank may deem relevant, additional studies on the following subjects may be required to supplement or inform the census survey: land tenure and transfer systems, including an inventory of common property natural resources from which people derive their livelihoods and sustenance, non-title-based usufruct systems governed by local recognized land allocation mechanisms, and any issues raised by different tenure systems in the project area; the patterns of social interaction in the affected communities, including social networks and social support systems, and how they will be affected by the project; and social and cultural characteristics of displaced communities, including a description of formal and informal institutions ) that may be relevant to the consultation strategy and to designing and implementing the resettlement activities. Legal framework. The findings of an analysis of legal framework, covering: the scope of the power of compulsory acquisition and imposition of land use restriction and the nature of compensation associated with it, in terms of both the valuation methodology and the timing of payment; the applicable legal and administrative procedures, including a description of the remedies available to displaced persons in the judicial process and the normal time frame for such procedures, and any available grievance redress mechanisms that may be relevant to the project; laws and regulations relating to the agencies responsible for implementing resettlement activities; and gaps, if any, between local laws and practices covering compulsory acquisition, imposition of land use restrictions and provision of resettlement measures and , and the mechanisms to bridge such gaps. Institutional framework. The findings of an analysis of the institutional framework covering: the identification of agencies responsible for resettlement activities and that may have a role in project implementation, including providing support for displaced persons; an assessment of the institutional capacity of such agencies and ; and any steps that are proposed to enhance the institutional capacity of agencies and responsible for resettlement implementation. Eligibility. Definition of displaced persons and for determining their eligibility for compenand other resettlement assistance, including cutoff dates. Valuation of and compensation for losses. The to be used in valuing losses to deter their replacement cost; and a description of proposed types and levels of compensation for natural resources and other assets under local and such supplementary measures as are necto achieve replacement cost for them. Community participation. Involvement of dispersons a summary of the views expressed and how these views were taken into account in preparing the resettlement plan; a review of the resettlement alternatives presented and the choices made by displaced persons regarding options available to them; and institutionalized arrangements by which displaced people can communicate their concerns to project authorities throughout planning and implementation, and measures to ensure that such vulnerable groups as indigenous people, ethnic minorities, the landless, and women are adequately represented. Implementation schedule. An implementation schedule providing anticipated dates for displacement, and estimated initiation and completion dates for all resettlement plan activities. The schedule should indicate how the resettlement activities are linked to the implementation of the overall project. Costs and budget. Tables showing categorized cost estimates for all resettlement activities, including allowances for inflation, population growth, and other contingencies; timetables for expenditures; sources of funds; and arrangements for timely flow of funds, and funding for resettlement, if any, in areas outside the jurisdiction of the implementing agencies. Grievance redress mechanism. The plan describes affordable and accessible procedures for third-party settlement of disputes arising from displacement or resettlement; such grievance mechanisms should take into account the availability of judicial recourse and community and traditional dispute settlement mechanisms. Monitoring and evaluation. Arrangements for monitoring of displacement and resettlement activities by the implementing agency, supplemented by third-party monitors as considered appropriate by the Bank, to ensure complete and objective information; performance monitoring indicators to measure inputs, outputs, and outcomes for resettlement activities; involvement of the displaced persons in the monitoring process; evaluation of results for a reasonable period after all resettlement activities have been completed; using the results of resettlement monitoring to guide subsequent implementation. Arrangements for adaptive management. The plan should include provisions for adapting resettlement implementation in response to unanticipated changes in project conditions, or unanticipated obstacles to achieving satisfactory resettlement outcomes. planning requirements where involves physical displacement When project circumstances require the physical of residents , resettlement require additional information and planning Additional requirements include: Transitional assistance. The plan describes to be provided for relocation of house members and their possessions . The plan describes any assistance to be provided for households cash compensation and securing their own housing, including construction of new If planned relocation sites are not ready for occupancy at the of physical displacement, the plan establishes transitional allowance sufficient to meet temporary rental expenses and other costs until occuis available. Site selection, site preparation, and relocation. planned relocation sites are to be prepared, resettlement plan describes the alternative relosites considered and explains sites selected, institutional and technical arrangements for identifying and preparing relocation sites, whether rural or urban, for which a combination of productive potential, locational advantages, and other factors is better or at least comparable to the advantages of the old sites, with an estimate of the time needed to acquire and transfer land and ancillary resources; identification and consideration of opportunities to improve local living standards by supplemental investment in infrastructure, facilities or services; any measures necessary to prevent land speculation or influx of ineligible persons at the selected sites; procedures for physical relocation under the project, including timetables for site preparation and transfer; and legal arrangements for regularizing tenure and transferring titles to those resettled, including provision of security of tenure for those previously lacking full legal rights to land or structures. Housing, infrastructure, and social services. to provide housing, infrastructure , and social services ; plans to maintain or provide a level of services to host populations; any necessary site development, engineering, and architectural designs for these facilities. Environmental protection and management. a description of the boundaries of the planned relocation sites; and an assessment of the environmental impacts of the proposed resettlement and measures to mitigate and manage these impacts . Consultation on relocation arrangements. The plan describes methods of consultation with physically displaced persons on their preferences regarding relocation alternatives available to them, including, as relevant, choices related to forms of compensation and transitional assistance, to relocating as individual households families or with preexisting communities or kinship groups, to sustaining existing patterns of group organization, and for relocation of, or retaining access to, cultural property . Integration with host populations. Measures to mitigate the impact of planned relocation sites on any host communities, including: consultations with host communities and local governments; arrangements for prompt tendering of any payment due the hosts for land or other assets provided in support of planned relocation sites; arrangements for identifying and addressing any conflict that may arise between those resettled and host communities; and any measures necessary to augment services in host communities to meet increased demands upon them, or to make them at least comparable to services available within planned relocation sites. Additional planning requirements where resettlement involves economic displacement If land acquisition or restrictions on use of, or access to, land or natural resources may cause significant economic displacement, arrangements to provide displaced persons with sufficient opportunity to improve, or at least restore, their livelihoods are also incorporated into the resettlement plan, or into a separate livelihoods improvement plan. These include: Direct land replacement. For those with agricultural livelihoods, the resettlement plan provides for an option to receive replacement land of equivalent productive value, or demonstrates that sufficient of equivalent value is unavailable. Where land is available, the plan describes and timing for its allocation to displaced Loss of access to land or resources. For those livelihood is affected by loss of land or use or access, including common property the resettlement plan describes means to substitutes or alternative resources, or othprovides support for alternative livelihoods. Support for alternative livelihoods. For all other of economically displaced persons, the plan describes feasible arrangements obtaining employment or for establishing a busiincluding provision of relevant supplemental including skills training, credit, licenses permits, or specialized equipment. As warranted, planning provides special assistance to minorities or vulnerable groups who may be in securing alternative livelihoods. Consideration of economic development oppor The resettlement plan identifies and any feasible opportunities to promote livelihoods as a result of resettlement This may include, for example, preferential project employment arrangements, support for of specialized products or markets, commercial zoning and trading arrangement or other measures. Where relevant, the plan also assess the feasibility of prospects for distributions to communities, or directly to persons, through establishment of benefit-sharing arrangements. Transitional support. The resettlement plan transitional support to those whose liveliwill be disrupted. This may include payment lost crops and lost natural resources, payment of profits for businesses, or payment of lost wages employees affected by business relocation. The provides that the transitional support continfor the duration of the transition period. resettlement framework The purpose of the resettlement framework is clarify resettlement principles, organizational and design criteria to be applied subprojects or project components to be preduring project implementation . Once the subproject or individual project are defined and the necessary inforbecomes available, such a framework will expanded into a specific plan proportionate to risks and impacts. Project activities that cause physical and or economic displacement not commence until such specific plans have finalized and approved by the Bank. The resettlement policy framework covers the following elements: a brief description of the project and components for which land acquisition and resettlement are required, and an explanation of why a resettlement policy framework rather than a resettlement plan is being prepared; principles and objectives governing resettlement preparation and implementation; a description of the process for preparing and approving resettlement plans; estimated displacement impacts and estimated numbers and categories of displaced persons, to the extent feasible; eligibility criteria for defining various categories of displaced persons; a legal framework reviewing the fit between borrower laws and regulations and Bank policy requirements and measures proposed to bridge any gaps between them; methods of valuing affected assets; organizational procedures for delivery of compensation and other resettlement assistance, including, for projects involving private sector intermediaries, the responsibilities of the financial intermediary, the government, and the private developer; a description of the implementation process, linking resettlement implementation to civil works; a description of grievance redress mechanisms; a description of the arrangements for funding resettlement, including the preparation and review of cost estimates, the flow of funds, and contingency arrangements; a description of mechanisms for consultations with, and participation of, displaced persons in planning, implementation, and monitoring; and arrangements for monitoring by the implementing agency and, if required, by third-party monitors. c. Process framework a process framework is prepared when Bank supported projects may cause restrictions in access to natural resources in legally designated parks and protected areas. The purpose of the process framework is to establish a process by which members of potentially affected communities participate in design of project components, determination of measures necessary to achieve the objectives of this , and implementation and monitoring of relevant project activities. Specifically, the process framework describes processes by which the following will be accomplished: Project components will be prepared and implemented. The document should briefly describe the project and components or activities that may involve new or more stringent restrictions on natural resource use. It should also describe the process by which potentially displaced persons participate in project design. Criteria for eligibility of affected persons will be determined. The document should establish that potentially affected communities will be involved in identifying any adverse impacts, assessing of the significance of impacts, and establishing of the criteria for eligibility for any mitigating or compensating measures necessary. Measures to assist affected persons in their efforts to improve their livelihoods or restore them, in real terms, to pre-displacement levels, while maintaining the sustainability of the park or protected area will be identified. The document should describe methods and procedures by which communities will identify and choose potential mitigating or compensating measures to be provided to those adversely affected, and procedures by which adversely affected community members will decide among the options available to them. Potential conflicts or grievances within or between affected communities will be resolved. The document should describe the process for resolving disputes relating to resource use restrictions that may arise between or among affected communities, and grievances that may arise from members of communities who are dissatisfied with the eligibility criteria, community planning measures, or actual implementation. the process framework should describe relating to the following: Administrative and legal procedures. The document should review agreements reached regarding the process approach with relevant administrative jurisdictions and line ministries . Monitoring arrangements. The document should review arrangements for participatory monitoring of project activities as they relate to impacts on persons within the project impact area, and for monitoring the effectiveness of measures taken to improve incomes, livelihoods and living standards. biodiversity Conservation and sustainable of living natural",
    "text_ngram":"introduction recognizes that project_related land_acquisition and restrictions on land_use can have adverse_impacts on communities and persons. Project_related land_acquisition or restrictions on land_use may cause physical_displacement , economic_displacement , or both. The term \u201cinvoluntary_resettlement\u201d refers to these impacts. Resettlement is considered involuntary when affected_persons or communities do not have the right to refuse land_acquisition or restrictions on land_use that result in displacement. \u201cLand_acquisition\u201d refers to all methods of obtaining land for project purposes, which may include outright purchase, expropriation of property and acquisition of access rights, such as easements or rights of way. Land_acquisition may also include: aacuisition of unoccupied or unutilied land whether or not the landholder relies upon such land for income or livelihood purposes; repossession of public land that is used or occupied by individuals or households; and project_impacts that result in land being submerged or otherwise rendered unusable or inaccessible. \u201cLand\u201d includes anything growing on or permanently affixed to land, such as crops, buildings and other improvements, and appurtenant water_bodies. 2\u201c Restrictions on land_use\u201d refers to limitations or prohibitions on the use of agricultural, residential, commercial or other land that are directly introduced and put into effect as part of the project. These may include restrictions on access to legally designated parks and protected areas, restrictions on access to other common_property_resources, and restrictions on land_use within utility easements or safety zones. \u201cLivelihood\u201d refers to the full range of means that individuals, families and communities utilize to make a living, such as wage_based income, agriculture, fishing, foraging, other natural resource_based livelihoods, petty trade and bartering. restrictions involuntary Experience and research indicate that physical economic_displacement, if unmitigated, may rise to severe economic, social and environrisks: production systems may be dismanpeople face impoverishment if their productive or other income sources are lost; people be relocated to environments where their pros kills are less applicable and the competi- . for resources greater; community institutions social networks may be weakened; kin groups be dispersed; and cultural identity, traditional and the potential for mutual help may diminished or lost. For these reasons, involresettlement should be avoided. Where resettlement is unavoidable, it will be and appropriate_measures to mitigate impacts on displaced_persons will be planned and implemented. To avoid involuntary_resettlement or, when unavoidable, minimize involuntary_resettlement by exploring project_design alternatives. To avoid forced eviction. To mitigate unavoidable adverse social and economic impacts from land_acquisition or restrictions on land_use by: a providing timely compensation for loss of assets at replacement voidance is the preferred approach in accordance with the hierarchy in . It is especially important to avoid or economic_displacement of those socially or ecovulnerable to hardship as a result. However, avoid may not be the preferred approach in situations where health or safety would be adversely affected as a result. may also be situations where resettlement can provide development opportunities for households or communiincluding improved housing and public_health conditions, security of tenure or other improvements to local standards.

To ensure that resettlement_activities are planned and implemented with appropriate disclosure_of_information, meaningful_consultation, and the informed participation of those affected. Scope of application The applicability of is established during the described in . This applies to permanent or temporary physical and economic_displacement resulting from the following types of land_acquisition or restrictions on \u201cReplacement_cost\u201d is defined as a method of valuation yielding compensation sufficient to replace assets, plus necessary transaction costs associated with asset replacement. Where functioning markets exist, replacement_cost is the market value as established through independent and competent real estate valuation, plus transaction costs. Where functioning markets do not exist, replacement_cost may be determined through alternative means, such as calculation of output_value for land or productive assets, or the undepreciated value of replacement material and labor for construction of structures or other fixed_assets, plus transaction costs. In all instances where physical_displacement results in loss of shelter, replacement_cost must at least be sufficient to enable purchase or construction of housing that meets acceptable minimum community standards of quality and safety. The valuation method for determining replacement_cost should be documented and included in relevant resettlement_planning documents. Transaction costs include administrative charges, registration or title fees, reasonable moving expenses, and any similar costs imposed on affected_persons. To ensure compensation at replacement_cost, planned compensation_rates may require updating in project_areas where inflation is high or the period of time between calculation of compensation_rates and delivery of compensation is extensive. 7\u201c Security of tenure\u201d means that resettled individuals or communities are resettled to a site that they can legally occupy, where they are protected from the risk of eviction and where the tenure_rights provided to them are socially and culturally appropriate. In no event will resettled persons be provided tenure_rights that are in effect weaker than the rights they had to the land or assets from which they have been displaced. use undertaken or imposed in connection with implementation: land_rights or land_use rights acquired or restricted through expropriation or other compulsory procedures in accordance with national_law; land_rights or land_use rights acquired or restricted through negotiated settlements with property_owners or those with legal_rights to the land, if failure to reach settlement would have resulted in expropriation or other compulsory procedures; Restrictions on land_use and access to natural_resources that cause a community or groups within a community to lose access to resource usage where they have traditional or customary tenure, or recognizable usage rights. This may include situations where legally designated protected areas, forests, biodiversity areas or buffer zones are established in connection with the project; Relocation of people without formal, traditional, or recognizable usage rights, who are occupying or utilizing land prior to a project specific cut_off date; Displacement of people as a result of project_impacts that render their land unusable or inaccessible; Restriction on access to land or use of other resources including communal property and natural_resources such as marine and aquatic resources, timber and non_timber forest products, freshwater, medicinal plants, hunting and gathering grounds and grazing and cropping areas; Notwithstanding the application of this to such situations, Borrower is encouraged to seek negotiated settlements with persons in a manner meeting the requirements of this in order to help avoid administrative or judicial delays associated with formal expropriation, and to the extent possible to the impacts on affected_persons associated with formal such situations, affected_persons frequently do not have forownership. This may include freshwater and marine environ This does not apply to restrictions of access to natural under community_based natural_resource manageprojects, i.e., where the community using the resources coldecides to restrict access to these resources, provided an assessment satisfactory to the Bank establishes that the decision_making process is adequate and reflects informed consensus, and that appropriate_measures been agreed and put in place to mitigate adverse_impacts, if on the vulnerable members of the community. land_rights or claims to land or resources relinquished by individuals or communities without full payment of compensation; and Land_acquisition or land_use_restrictions occurring prior to the project, but which were undertaken or initiated in anticipation of, or in preparation for, the project. This does not apply to impacts on incomes or livelihoods that are not a direct result of land_acquisition or land_use_restrictions imposed by the project. Such impacts will be addressed in accordance with . This does not apply to voluntary, legally recorded market transactions in which the seller is given a genuine opportunity to retain the land and to refuse to sell it, and is fully informed about available choices and their implications. However, where such voluntary land_transactions may result in the displacement of persons, other than the seller, who occupy, use or claim rights to the land in question, this will apply. Where a project supports land_titling or other activities intended to confirm, regularize or determine land_rights, a social, legal and institutional In some circumstances, it may be proposed that part or all of the land to be used by the project is donated on a voluntary basis without payment of full compensation. Subject to prior Bank approval, this may be acceptable providing the Borrower demonstrates that: the potential donor or donors have been appropriately informed and consulted about the project and the choices available to them; potential donors are aware that refusal is an option, and have confirmed in writing their willingness to proceed with the donation; the amount of land being donated is minor and will not reduce the donor\u2019s remaining land_area below that required to maintain the donor\u2019s livelihood at current levels; no household relocation is involved; the donor is expected to benefit directly from the project; and for community or collective land, donation can only occur with the consent of individuals using or occupying the land. The Borrower will maintain a transparent record of all consultations and agreements reached. This may include situations where a project supports voluntary transactions between communities, governments and investors involving significant areas of land . In such cases, in applying the relevant_provisions of this , special care must be taken to ensure: a that all tenure_rights and claims affecting the land in question are systematically and impartially identified; that potentially affected individuals, groups or communities are meaningfully consulted, informed of their rights, and provided reliable information concerning environmental, economic, social and food security impacts of the proposed investment; that community stakeholders are enabled to negotiate fair value and appropriate conditions for the transfer; that appropriate compensation, benefit sharing and grievance_redress_mechanisms are put in place; that terms and conditions of the transfer are transparent; and mechanisms are put in place for monitoring compliance with those terms and conditions. will be required under .

See , footnote. Such claims could be derived from adverse possession or from or traditional tenure arrangements. Project_design The Borrower will demonstrate that involuntary land_acquisition or restrictions on land_use are limited to direct_project requirements for clearly specified project purposes within a clearly specified period of time. The Borrower will consider feasible alternative_project designs to avoid or minimize land_acquisition or restrictions on land_use, especially where this would result in physical or economic_displacement, while balancing environmental, social, and financial_costs and benefits, and paying particular_attention to gender impacts and impacts on the poor and vulnerable. Compensation and benefits for affected_persons When land_acquisition or restrictions on land_use cannot be avoided, the Borrower will offer affected_persons compensation at replacement_cost, and other assistance as may be necessary to help them improve or at least restore their standards of living or livelihoods, subect to the proisions of paragraph through of this . Compensation standards for categories of land and fixed_assets will be disclosed and applied consistently. Compensation_rates may be subject to upward adjustment where negotiation strategies are employed. In all cases, a clear basis for calculation of compensation will be documented, and compensation distributed in accordance with transparent procedures. Where livelihoods of displaced_persons are land_based, or where land is collectively owned, the Borrower will offer the displaced_persons an option for replacement_land in accordance with paragraph 3, unless it can be demonstrated to the Bank\u2019s satisfaction that equivalent replacement_land is unavailable. As the nature and objectives of the project may allow, the Borrower will also provide opportunities to displaced communities and persons to derive appropriate development benefits from the project. In the case of affected_persons under paragraph , resettlement_assistance will be provided in lieu of compensation for land, as described in paragraphs and . The Borrower will take possession of acquired land and related assets only after compensation in accordance with this has been made available At the request of affected_persons, it may be necessary to acquire entire land parcels if partial acquisition would render the remainder economically unviable, or make the remaining parcel unsafe or inaccessible for human use or occupancy. The term \u201cland_based\u201d includes livelihood activities such as rotational cropping and grazing of livestock as well as the harvesting of natural_resources. where applicable, displaced people have been and moving allowances have been proto the displaced_persons in addition to compensation In addition, livelihood_restoration and programs will commence in a timely in order to ensure that affected_persons are prepared to take advantage of alternative livelihood opportunities as the need to do so In certain cases there may be significant difrelated to the payment of compensation particular affected_persons, for example, where efforts to contact absentee owners have where project_affected persons have rejected that has been offered to them in with the approved plan, or where comclaims to the ownership_of_lands or assets are to lengthy legal proceedings. On an excepbasis, with prior agreement of the Bank, and the Borrower demonstrates that all reason efforts to resolve such matters have been taken, Borrower may deposit compensation funds as by the plan into an interest_bearing or other deposit account and proceed with relevant project_activities. Compensation placed escrow will be made available to eligible persons a timely_manner as issues are resolved. engagement The Borrower will engage with affected comincluding host_communities, through process of stakeholder_engagement described . Decision_making processes related to and livelihood_restoration will include and alternatives from which affected permay choose. Disclosure of relevant information meaningful_participation of affected community and persons will take place during the considof alternative_project designs referred to in 1, and thereafter throughout the planimplementation, monitoring, and evaluation the compensation process, livelihood_restoration and relocation process. Additional proviapply to consultations with displaced Indig Peoples, in accordance with . The consultation_process should ensure that perspectives are obtained and their inter factored into all aspects of resettlement_plan and implementation. Addressing livelihood may require intra_household analysis in where women\u2019s and men\u2019s livelihoods are differently. Women\u2019s and men\u2019s preferin terms of compensation mechanisms, such replacement_land or alternative access to natural rather than in cash, should be explored. Grievance_mechanism The Borrower will ensure that a grievance_mechanism for the project is in place, in accordance with as early as possible in project_development to address specific concerns about compensation, relocation or livelihood_restoration measures raised by displaced_persons in a timely fashion. Where possible, such grievance_mechanisms will utilize existing formal or informal grievance_mechanisms suitable for project purposes, supplemented as needed with project_specific arrangements designed to resolve disputes in an impartial manner. Planning and implementation Where land_acquisition or restrictions on land_use are unavoidable, the Borrower will, as part of the , conduct a census to identify the persons who will be affected by the project, to establish an inventory of land and assets to be affected, to determine who will be eligible for compensation and assistance, and to discourage ineligible persons, such as opportunistic settlers, from claiming benefits. The social_assessment will also address the claims of communities or groups who, for valid reasons, may not be present in the project_area during the time of the census, such as seasonal resource users. In conjunction with the census, the Borrower will establish a cutoff_date for eligibility. Information regarding the cut_off date will be well documented and will be disseminated throughout the project_area at regular intervals in written and nonwritten forms and in relevant local languages. This will include posted warnings that persons settling in the project_area after the cutoff_date may be subject to removal. To address the issues identified in the , the Borrower will prepare a plan proportionate to the risks and impacts associated with the project: For projects with minor land_acquisition or restrictions on land_use, as a result of which there will be no significant_impact on incomes See Annex Such inventory should include a detailed account, derived through a consultative, impartial and transparent process, of the full range of rights held or asserted by affected_people, including those based on custom or practice, secondary rights such as rights of access or use for livelihoods purposes, rights held in common, etc. Documentation of ownership or occupancy and compensation payments should be issued in the names of both spouses or single heads of households as relevant, and other resettlement_assistance, such as skills training, access to credit, and job opportunities, should be equally available to women and adapted to their needs. Where national_law and tenure systems do not recognize the rights of women to hold or contract in property, measures should be considered to provide women as much protection as possible with the objective to achieve equity with men. See Annex or livelihoods, the plan will establish eligibility_criteria for affected_persons, set out procedures and standards for compensation, and incorporate arrangements for consultations, monitoring and addressing grievances; For projects causing physical_displacement, the plan will set out the additional measures relevant to relocation of affected_persons; For projects involving economic_displacement with significant_impacts on livelihoods or income_generation, the plan will set out the additional measures relating to livelihood improvement or restoration; and For projects that may impose changes in land_use that restrict access to resources in legally designated parks or protected areas or other common_property_resources on which local_people may depend for livelihood purposes, the plan will establish a participatory process for determining appropriate restrictions on use and set out the mitigation_measures to address adverse_impacts on livelihoods that may result from such restrictions. The Borrower\u2019s plan will establish the roles and relating to financing and implemenand include arrangements for contingency to meet unanticipated costs, as well as for timely and coordinated response unforeseen circumstances impeding progress desired outcomes. The full costs of reset activities necessary to achieve the objecof the project are included in the total_costs of project. The costs of resettlement, like the costs other project_activities, are treated as a charge the economic_benefits of the project; and net_benefits to resettlers are added to the stream of the project. The Borrower will establish procedures to moniand evaluate the implementation of the plan will take corrective action as necessary during to achieve the objectives of this The extent of monitoring_activities will be proto the project\u2019s risks and impacts. For all with significant involuntary_resettlement the Borrower will retain competent reset professionals to monitor the implementaof resettlement_plans, design corrective actions necessary, provide advice on compliance with and produce periodic monitoring_reports. persons will be consulted during the moniprocess. Periodic monitoring_reports will be or projects with significant resettlement_impacts and complex measures, the Borrower may consider preparing a resettlement project for Bank_support. prepared and affected_persons will be informed about monitoring results in a timely_manner. Implementation of the Borrower\u2019s plan will be considered completed when the adverse_impacts of resettlement have been addressed in a manner that is consistent with the relevant plan as well as the objectives of this . For all projects with significant involuntary_resettlement impacts, the Borrower will commission an external completion audit of the plan when all mitigation_measures have been substantially completed. The completion audit will be undertaken by competent resettlement professionals, will assess whether livelihoods and living_standards have been improved or at least restored and, as necessary, will propose corrective actions to meet objectives not yet achieved. Where the likely nature or magnitude of the land_acquisition or restrictions on land_use related to a project with potential to cause physical and or economic_displacement is unknown during project_preparation, the Borrower will develop a framework establishing general principles and procedures compatible with this . Once the individual project_components are defined and the necessary information becomes available, such a framework will be expanded into one or more specific plans proportionate to potential_risks and impacts. No physical and or economic_displacement will occur until plans required by this have been finalized and approved by the Bank. B. displacement Physical_displacement In the case of physical_displacement, the Borrower will develop a plan that covers, at a minimum, the applicable requirements of this regardless of the number of people affected. The plan will be designed to mitigate the negative_impacts of displacement and, as warranted, to identify development opportunities. It will include a resettlement_budget and implementation_schedule, and establish the entitlements of all categories of affected_persons . Particular_attention will be paid to gender aspects and the needs of the poor and the vulnerable. The Borrower will document all transactions to acquire land_rights, provision of compensation and other assistance associated with relocation activities. If people living in the project_area are required to move to another location, the Borrower will: aoffer displaced_persons choices among feasible resettlement options, including adequate replacement_housing or cash_compensation; and provide relocation assistance suited to the needs of each group of displaced_persons. New resettlement_sites will offer living_conditions at least equivalent those previously enjoyed, or consistent with preminimum codes or standards, whichever set standards is higher. If new resettlement_sites are be prepared, host_communities will be consulted planning options, and resettlement_plans ensure continued access, at least at existing levor standards, for host_communities to facilities services. The displaced_persons\u2019 preferences respect to relocating in preexisting community and groups will be respected wherever possible. social and cultural institutions of the dispersons and any host_communities will be In the case of physically displaced_persons under or , the Borrower will offer the of replacement property of equal or higher with security of tenure, equivalent or better and advantages of location, or cash at replacement_cost. Compensation kind should be considered in lieu of cash. In the case of physically displaced_persons under , the Borrower will provide arrangement to allow them to obtain adequate housing security of tenure. Where these displaced perown structures, the Borrower will compensate for the loss of assets other than land, such dwellings and other improvements to the land, replacement_cost. Based on consultation with displaced_persons, the Borrower will provide assistance in lieu of compensation for sufficient for them to restore their standards living at an adequate alternative site. The Borrower is not required to compensate or those who encroach on the project_area after cutoff_date for eligibility, provided the cut_off has been clearly established and made public. payment of cash_compensation for lost land and other assets be appropriate where: livelihoods are not land_based; are land based but the land taken for the proect a small fraction of the affected asset and the residual land economically viable; or active markets for land, housing, labor exist, displaced_persons use such markets, there is supply of land and housing, and the Borrower has to the satisfaction of the Bank that insufficient land is available. here the Borrower demonstrates that an affected person substantial income from multiple illegal rental units, compensation and other assistance that would otherwise available to such person for non_land assets and livelihood under this paragraph may be reduced with the prior of the Bank, to better reflect the objectives of this . elocation of informal settlers in urban_areas may involve For example, the relocated families may gain secuof tenure, but they may lose locational advantages that may essential to livelihoods, especially among the poor or vulner Changes in location that may affect livelihood opportunities be addressed in accordance with the relevant_provisions this ). The Borrower will not resort to forced evictions of affected_persons. \u201cForced eviction\u201d is defined as the permanent or temporary removal against the will of individuals, families, and or communities from the homes and or land which they occupy without the provision of, and access to, appropriate forms of legal and other protection, including all applicable procedures and principles in this . The exercise of eminent domain, compulsory acquisition or similar powers by a Borrower will not be considered to be forced eviction providing it complies with the requirements of national_law and the provisions of this , and is conducted in a manner consistent with basic principles of due process . As an alternative to displacement, the Borrower may consider negotiating in situ land development arrangements by which those to be affected may elect to accept a partial loss_of_land or localized relocation in return for improvements that will increase the value of their property after development. Any person not wishing to participate will be allowed to opt instead for full compensation and other assistance as required in this . Economic_displacement In the case of projects affecting livelihoods or income_generation, the Borrower\u2019s plan will include measures to allow affected_persons to improve, or at least restore, their incomes or livelihoods. The plan will establish the entitlements of affected_persons and or communities, paying particular_attention to gender aspects and the needs of vulnerable segments of communities, and will ensure that these are provided in a transparent, consistent, and equitable manner. The plan will incorporate arrangements to monitor the effectiveness of livelihood measures during implementation, as well as evaluation once implementation is completed. The mitigation of economic_displacement will be considered complete when the completion audit concludes that affected_persons or communities have received all of the assistance for which they are eligible, and have been provided with adequate opportunity to reestablish their livelihoods. Economically displaced_persons who face loss of assets or access to assets will be compensated for such loss at replacement_cost: In cases where land_acquisition or restrictions on land_use affect commercial enterprises, This includes shops, restaurants, services, manufacturing facilities and other enterprises, regardless of size and whether licensed or unlicensed. affected business owners will be compensated for the cost of identifying a viable alternative location; for lost net_income during the period of transition; for the cost of the transfer and reinstallation of the plant, machinery, or other equipment; and for reestablishing commercial activities. Affected employees will receive assistance for temporary loss of wages and, if necessary, assistance in identifying alternative employment_opportunities; In cases affecting persons with legal_rights or claims to land that are recognized or recognizable under national_law and ), replacement property of equal or greater value will be provided, or, where appropriate, cash_compensation at replacement_cost; and Economically displaced_persons who are without legally recognizable claims to land , at replacement_cost. Additionally, the Borrower will provide assistance in lieu of land_compensation sufficient to provide such persons with an opportunity to reestablish livelihoods elsewhere. The Borrower is not required to compensate or assist persons who encroach on the project_area after the cutoff_date for eligibility. Economically displaced_persons will be proopportunities to improve, or at least restore, means of income_earning capacity, production and standards of living: For persons whose livelihoods are land_based, replacement_land that has a combination of productive potential, locational advantages, and other factors at least equivalent to that being lost will be offered where feasible; For persons whose livelihoods are natural resource_based and where project_related restrictions on access envisaged in paragraph apply, measures will be implemented to either allow continued access to affected resources or to provide access to alternative resources with equivalent livelihood_earning potential and accessibility. Where common_property_resources are affected, benefits and compensation associated with restrictions on natural_resource usage may be collective in nature; and If it is demonstrated that replacement_land or resources are unavailable, the Borrower will offer economically displaced_persons options for alternative income earning opportunities, such as credit facilities, skills training, business start_up assistance, employment_opportunities, or cash assistance additional to compensation for assets. Cash assistance alone, however, frequently fails to provide affected_persons with the productive means or skills to restore livelihoods. Transitional support will be provided as necessary to all economically displaced_persons, based on a reasonable estimate of the time required to restore their income_earning capacity, production levels, and standards of living. c. collaboration with other responsible agencies or subnational jurisdictions The Borrower will establish means of collaboration between the agency or entity responsible for project_implementation and any other governmental agencies, subnational jurisdictions or entities that are responsible for any aspects of land_acquisition, resettlement_planning, or provision of necessary assistance. In addition, where the capacity of other responsible agencies is limited, the Borrower will actively support resettlement_planning, implementation, and monitoring. If the procedures or standards of other responsible agencies do not meet the relevant requirements of this , the Borrower will prepare supplemental arrangements or provisions for inclusion in the resettlement_plan to address identified shortcomings. The plan will also specify financial responsibilities for each of the agencies involved, appropriate timing and sequencing for implementation steps, and coordination arrangements for addressing financial contingencies or responding to unforeseen circumstances. d. technical and financial_assistance The Borrower may request technical_assistance from the Bank to strengthen Borrower capacity, or the capacity of other responsible agencies, for resettlement_planning, implementation and monitoring. Such forms of assistance may include staff_training, assistance in formulating new regulations or policies relating to land_acquisition or other aspects of resettlement, financing for assessments or other investment_costs associated with physical or economic_displacement, or other purposes. The Borrower may request the Bank to finance either a component of the main investment causing displacement and requiring resettlement, or a free_standing resettlement project with appropriate cross_conditionalities, processed and implemented in parallel with the investment that causes the displacement. The Borrower may also request the Bank to finance resettlement even though it is not financing the main investment that makes resettlement necessary. involuntary_resettlement This Annex describes the elements of the plans physical and or economic_displacement in paragraph of .

Arrangements for adaptive management. The plan should include provisions for adapting resettlement_implementation in response to unanticipated changes in project conditions, or unanticipated obstacles to achieving satisfactory resettlement outcomes. planning requirements where involves physical_displacement When project circumstances require the physical of residents , resettlement require additional_information and planning Additional requirements include: Transitional assistance. The plan describes to be provided for relocation of house members and their possessions . The plan describes any assistance to be provided for households cash_compensation and securing their own housing, including construction of new If planned relocation_sites are not ready for occupancy at the of physical_displacement, the plan establishes transitional allowance sufficient to meet temporary rental expenses and other costs until occuis available. Site selection, site preparation, and relocation. planned relocation_sites are to be prepared, resettlement_plan describes the alternative relosites considered and explains sites selected, institutional and technical arrangements for identifying and preparing relocation_sites, whether rural or urban, for which a combination of productive potential, locational advantages, and other factors is better or at least comparable to the advantages of the old sites, with an estimate of the time needed to acquire and transfer land and ancillary resources; identification and consideration of opportunities to improve local living_standards by supplemental investment in infrastructure, facilities or services; any measures necessary to prevent land speculation or influx of ineligible persons at the selected sites; procedures for physical relocation under the project, including timetables for site preparation and transfer; and legal arrangements for regularizing tenure and transferring titles to those resettled, including provision of security of tenure for those previously lacking full legal_rights to land or structures.

Integration with host populations. Measures to mitigate the impact of planned relocation_sites on any host_communities, including: consultations with host_communities and local_governments; arrangements for prompt tendering of any payment due the hosts for land or other assets provided in support of planned relocation_sites; arrangements for identifying and addressing any conflict that may arise between those resettled and host_communities; and any measures necessary to augment services in host_communities to meet increased demands upon them, or to make them at least comparable to services available within planned relocation_sites. Additional planning requirements where resettlement involves economic_displacement If land_acquisition or restrictions on use of, or access to, land or natural_resources may cause significant economic_displacement, arrangements to provide displaced_persons with sufficient opportunity to improve, or at least restore, their livelihoods are also incorporated into the resettlement_plan, or into a separate livelihoods improvement plan. These include: Direct land replacement. For those with agricultural livelihoods, the resettlement_plan provides for an option to receive replacement_land of equivalent productive value, or demonstrates that sufficient of equivalent value is unavailable. Where land is available, the plan describes and timing for its allocation to displaced Loss of access to land or resources. For those livelihood is affected by loss_of_land or use or access, including common_property the resettlement_plan describes means to substitutes or alternative resources, or othprovides support for alternative livelihoods.

This may include payment lost crops and lost natural_resources, payment of profits for businesses, or payment of lost wages employees affected by business relocation. The provides that the transitional support continfor the duration of the transition period. resettlement framework The purpose of the resettlement framework is clarify resettlement principles, organizational and design criteria to be applied subprojects or project_components to be preduring project_implementation . Once the subproject or individual project are defined and the necessary inforbecomes available, such a framework will expanded into a specific plan proportionate to risks and impacts. Project_activities that cause physical and or economic_displacement not commence until such specific plans have finalized and approved by the Bank. The resettlement_policy_framework covers the following elements: a brief description of the project and components for which land_acquisition and resettlement are required, and an explanation of why a resettlement_policy_framework rather than a resettlement_plan is being prepared; principles and objectives governing resettlement preparation and implementation; a description of the process for preparing and approving resettlement_plans; estimated displacement impacts and estimated numbers and categories of displaced_persons, to the extent feasible; eligibility_criteria for defining various categories of displaced_persons; a legal_framework reviewing the fit between borrower laws and regulations and Bank policy requirements and measures proposed to bridge any gaps between them; methods of valuing affected assets; organizational procedures for delivery of compensation and other resettlement_assistance, including, for projects involving private_sector intermediaries, the responsibilities of the financial intermediary, the government, and the private developer; a description of the implementation process, linking resettlement_implementation to civil_works; a description of grievance_redress_mechanisms; a description of the arrangements for funding resettlement, including the preparation and review of cost_estimates, the flow of funds, and contingency arrangements; a description of mechanisms for consultations with, and participation of, displaced_persons in planning, implementation, and monitoring; and arrangements for monitoring by the implementing agency and, if required, by third_party monitors. c. Process_framework a process_framework is prepared when Bank supported projects may cause restrictions in access to natural_resources in legally designated parks and protected areas. The purpose of the process_framework is to establish a process by which members of potentially affected_communities participate in design of project_components, determination of measures necessary to achieve the objectives of this , and implementation and monitoring of relevant project_activities. Specifically, the process_framework describes processes by which the following will be accomplished: Project_components will be prepared and implemented. The document should briefly describe the project and components or activities that may involve new or more stringent restrictions on natural resource_use. It should also describe the process by which potentially displaced_persons participate in project_design. Criteria for eligibility of affected_persons will be determined. The document should establish that potentially affected_communities will be involved in identifying any adverse_impacts, assessing of the significance of impacts, and establishing of the criteria for eligibility for any mitigating or compensating measures necessary. Measures to assist affected_persons in their efforts to improve their livelihoods or restore them, in real_terms, to pre_displacement levels, while maintaining the sustainability of the park or protected area will be identified. The document should describe methods and procedures by which communities will identify and choose potential mitigating or compensating measures to be provided to those adversely affected, and procedures by which adversely affected community members will decide among the options available to them. Potential conflicts or grievances within or between affected_communities will be resolved. The document should describe the process for resolving disputes relating to resource_use restrictions that may arise between or among affected_communities, and grievances that may arise from members of communities who are dissatisfied with the eligibility_criteria, community planning measures, or actual implementation. the process_framework should describe relating to the following: Administrative and legal procedures. The document should review agreements reached regarding the process approach with relevant administrative jurisdictions and line ministries . Monitoring arrangements. The document should review arrangements for participatory monitoring of project_activities as they relate to impacts on persons within the project_impact area, and for monitoring the effectiveness of measures taken to improve incomes, livelihoods and living_standards. biodiversity Conservation and sustainable of living natural"

Additional requirements on protection of cultural heritage are out in . design and documentation will be developed as set out below. The Borrower\u2019s proposed measures and actions will be developed in consultation with the affected Indigenous Peoples Sub-Saharan African Historically Under served Traditional Local Communities and contained in a time-bound plan, such as an Indigenous Peoples Sub-Saharan African Historically Under served Traditional Local Communities plan. The scope and scale of the plan will be proportionate to the potential risks and impacts of the project. The format and title of the plan will be adjusted as appropriate to the project or country context, and will reflect any alternative terminology for the Indigenous Peoples, as referred to in paragraph Projects designed solely to benefit indigenous peoples Sub-Saharan African historically under served traditional local communities Where projects are designed to provide benefits only to Indigenous Peoples Sub-Saharan African Historically Under served Traditional Local Communities, the Borrower will proactively engage with the relevant Indigenous Peoples Sub-Saharan African Historically Under served Traditional Local Communities to ensure their ownership and participation in project design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation. The Borrower will also consult with them as to the cultural appropriateness of proposed services or facilities, and will seek to identify and address any economic or social constraints that may limit opportunities to benefit from, or participate in, the project. When Indigenous Peoples Sub-Saharan African Historically Under served Traditional Local Communities are the sole, or the overwhelming majority of, project beneficiaries, the elements of the plan may be included in the overall project design, and preparation of a stand-alone Indigenous Peoples Sub Saharan African Historically Under served Traditional Local Communities plan is not necessary. Projects where indigenous peoples Sub-Saharan African historically under served traditional local communities are not the sole beneficiaries When Indigenous Peoples Sub-Saharan African Historically Under served Traditional Local Communities are not the only beneficiaries of the project, planning requirements will vary with circumstances. The Borrower will design and implement the project in a manner that provides affected Indigenous Peoples Sub-Saharan African Historically Under served Traditional Local Communities with equitable access to project benefits. The concerns or preferences of Indigenous Peoples Sub-Saharan African Historically Under served Tradi tional Local Communities will be addressed through consultation and project design, and will summarize the consultation and describe how Indigenous Peoples African Historically Under served Tra Local Communities\u2019 issues have been in project design. Arrangements for consultations during implementation and will also be described.

In certain circumstances, a planning frame will be appropriate. measures in alignment with the mitigation hierarchy described in as well as opportunities for culturally appropriate and sustainable development benefits. The scope of assessment and mitigation will include cultural impacts as well as physical impacts. The Borrower will ensure the timely delivery of agreed measures to affected Indigenous Peoples Sub-Saharan African Historically Under served Traditional Local Communities. The determination, delivery, and distribution of compensation and shared benefits to affected Indigenous Peoples Sub-Saharan African Historically Under served Traditional Local Communities will take account of the institutions, rules and customs of these Indigenous Peoples Sub-Saharan African Historically Under served Traditional Local Communities as well as their level of interaction with mainstream society. Eligibility for compensation can either be individually or collectively-based, or be a combination of both. Where compensation occurs on a collective basis, as far as practicable mechanisms that promote the effective distribution of compensation to all eligible members, or collective use of compensation in a manner that benefits all members of the group, will be defined and implemented. Various factors including, but not limited to, the nature of the project, the project context and the vulnerability of affected Indigenous Peoples Sub Saharan African Historically Under served Traditional Local Communities will determine how affected Indigenous Peoples Sub-Saharan African Historically Under served Traditional Local Communities will benefit from the project. Identified opportunities will aim to address the goals and preferences of the affected Indigenous Peoples Sub-Saharan African Historically Under served Traditional Local Communities, including improving their standard of living and livelihoods in a culturally appropriate manner, and to foster the long-term sustainability of the natural resources on which they depend.

Additional requirements on protection of cultural heritage are out in . design and documentation will be developed as set out below. The Borrower\u2019s proposed measures and actions will be developed in consultation with the affected Indigenous Peoples Sub-Saharan African Historically Under served Traditional Local Communities and contained in a time-bound plan, such as an Indigenous Peoples Sub-Saharan African Historically Under served Traditional Local Communities plan. The scope and scale of the plan will be proportionate to the potential risks and impacts of the project. The format and title of the plan will be adjusted as appropriate to the project or country context, and will reflect any alternative terminology for the Indigenous Peoples, as referred to in paragraph Projects designed solely to benefit indigenous peoples Sub-Saharan African historically under served traditional local communities Where projects are designed to provide benefits only to Indigenous Peoples Sub-Saharan African Historically Under served Traditional Local Communities, the Borrower will proactively engage with the relevant Indigenous Peoples Sub-Saharan African Historically Under served Traditional Local Communities to ensure their ownership and participation in project design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation. The Borrower will also consult with them as to the cultural appropriateness of proposed services or facilities, and will seek to identify and address any economic or social constraints that may limit opportunities to benefit from, or participate in, the project. When Indigenous Peoples Sub-Saharan African Historically Under served Traditional Local Communities are the sole, or the overwhelming majority of, project beneficiaries, the elements of the plan may be included in the overall project design, and preparation of a stand-alone Indigenous Peoples Sub Saharan African Historically Under served Traditional Local Communities plan is not necessary. Projects where indigenous peoples Sub-Saharan African historically under served traditional local communities are not the sole beneficiaries When Indigenous Peoples Sub-Saharan African Historically Under served Traditional Local Communities are not the only beneficiaries of the project, planning requirements will vary with circumstances. The Borrower will design and implement the project in a manner that provides affected Indigenous Peoples Sub-Saharan African Historically Under served Traditional Local Communities with equitable access to project benefits. The concerns or preferences of Indigenous Peoples Sub-Saharan African Historically Under served Tradi tional Local Communities will be addressed through consultation and project design, and will summarize the consultation and describe how Indigenous Peoples African Historically underserved traditional local Communities\u2019 issues have been in project design. Arrangements for consultations during implementation and will also be described.

In certain circumstances, a planning frame will be appropriate. measures in alignment with the mitigation hierarchy described in as well as opportunities for culturally appropriate and sustainable development benefits. The scope of assessment and mitigation will include cultural impacts as well as physical impacts. The Borrower will ensure the timely delivery of agreed measures to affected Indigenous Peoples Sub-Saharan African Historically Under served Traditional Local Communities. The determination, delivery, and distribution of compensation and shared benefits to affected Indigenous Peoples Sub-Saharan African Historically Under served Traditional Local Communities will take account of the institutions, rules and customs of these Indigenous Peoples Sub-Saharan African Historically Under served Traditional Local Communities as well as their level of interaction with mainstream society. Eligibility for compensation can either be individually or collectively-based, or be a combination of both. Where compensation occurs on a collective basis, as far as practicable mechanisms that promote the effective distribution of compensation to all eligible members, or collective use of compensation in a manner that benefits all members of the group, will be defined and implemented. Various factors including, but not limited to, the nature of the project, the project context and the vulnerability of affected Indigenous Peoples Sub Saharan African Historically Under served Traditional Local Communities will determine how affected Indigenous Peoples Sub-Saharan African Historically Under served Traditional Local Communities will benefit from the project. Identified opportunities will aim to address the goals and preferences of the affected Indigenous Peoples Sub-Saharan African Historically Under served Traditional Local Communities, including improving their standard of living and livelihoods in a culturally appropriate manner, and to foster the long-term sustainability of the natural resources on which they depend. Meaningful consultation tailored to indigenous peoples Sub-Saharan African historically under served traditional local communities To promote effective project design, to build local project support or ownership, and to reduce the risk of project-related delays or controversies, the Borrower will undertake an engagement process with affected Indigenous Peoples Sub-Saharan Considerations relating to cultural impacts may include, for example, the language of instruction and curriculum content in education projects, or culturally sensitive or gender-sensitive procedures in projects such as health projects, and others. Where control of resources, assets and decision making are predominantly collective in nature, efforts will be made to ensure that, where possible, benefits and compensation are collective, and take account of inter generational differences and needs.

In certain circumstances, a planning frame will be appropriate. measures in alignment with the mitigation_hierarchy described in as well as opportunities for culturally appropriate and sustainable_development benefits. The scope of assessment and mitigation will include cultural impacts as well as physical impacts. The Borrower will ensure the timely delivery of agreed measures to affected indigenous_peoples Sub_Saharan African Historically Under served traditional_local_communities. The determination, delivery, and distribution of compensation and shared benefits to affected indigenous_peoples Sub_Saharan African Historically Under served traditional_local_communities will take account of the institutions, rules and customs of these indigenous_peoples Sub_Saharan African Historically Under served traditional_local_communities as well as their level of interaction with mainstream society. Eligibility for compensation can either be individually or collectively_based, or be a combination of both. Where compensation occurs on a collective basis, as far as practicable mechanisms that promote the effective distribution of compensation to all eligible members, or collective use of compensation in a manner that benefits all members of the group, will be defined and implemented. Various factors including, but not limited to, the nature of the project, the project context and the vulnerability of affected indigenous_peoples Sub Saharan African Historically Under served traditional_local_communities will determine how affected indigenous_peoples Sub_Saharan African Historically Under served traditional_local_communities will benefit from the project. Identified opportunities will aim to address the goals and preferences of the affected indigenous_peoples Sub_Saharan African Historically Under served traditional_local_communities, including improving their standard of living and livelihoods in a culturally appropriate manner, and to foster the long_term_sustainability of the natural_resources on which they depend. Meaningful_consultation tailored to indigenous_peoples Sub_Saharan African historically under served traditional_local_communities To promote effective project_design, to build local project_support or ownership, and to reduce the risk of project_related delays or controversies, the Borrower will undertake an engagement process with affected indigenous_peoples Sub_Saharan Considerations relating to cultural impacts may include, for example, the language of instruction and curriculum content in education projects, or culturally sensitive or gender_sensitive procedures in projects such as health projects, and others. Where control of resources, assets and decision_making are predominantly collective in nature, efforts will be made to ensure that, where possible, benefits and compensation are collective, and take account of inter generational differences and needs.

Through the environmental and social\nassessment, the Borrower will determine the poten-\ntial risks and impacts of the proposed activities of\nthe project on cultural heritage.\n9. The Borrower will avoid impacts on cultural heri-\ntage. When avoidance of impacts is not possible, the\nBorrower will identify and implement measures to\naddress impacts on cultural heritage in accordance\nwith the mitigation hierarchy.1 Where appropriate,\n1 Mitigation measures include, for example, relocating or modify-\ning the physical footprint of the project; conservation and reha-\nbilitation in situ; relocation of cultural heritage; documentation;\nstrengthening the capacity of national and subnational insti-\ntutions responsible for managing cultural heritage affected by\nthe project; establishment of a monitoring system to track the\nprogress and efficacy of these activities; establishment of an\nimplementation schedule and required budget for the identified\nmitigation measures; and cataloguing of finds.

This sets out general provisions on risks and to cultural heritage from project activities. sets out additional requirements for cultural in the context of Indigenous Peoples. the social and cultural values of biodi Provisions on Stakeholder Engagement and Disclosure are set out in . To protect cultural heritage from the adverse impacts of project activities and support its preservation. To address cultural heritage as an integral aspect of sustainable development. To promote meaningful consultation with stakeholders regarding cultural heritage. To promote the equitable sharing of benefits from the use of cultural heritage. of application The applicability of this is established during described . The term \u2018cultural heritage\u2019 encompasses tanand intangible heritage, which may be recand valued at a local, regional, national or level, as follows: Tangible cultural heritage, which includes movable or immovable objects, sites, structures, groups of structures, and natural features and landscapes that have archaeological, paleontological, historical, architectural, religious, aesthetic, or other cultural significance.

The requirements of this will apply to all projects that are likely to have risks or impacts on cultural heritage. This will include a project which: Involves excavations, demolition, movement of earth, flooding or other changes in the physical environment; Is located within a legally protected area or a legally defined buffer zone; Is located in, or in the vicinity of, a recognized cultural heritage site; or Is specifically designed to support the conservation, management and use of cultural heritage. The requirements of apply to cultural heritage regardless of whether or not it has been legally protected or previously identified or disturbed. The requirements of apply to intangible cultural heritage only if a physical component of a project will have a material impact on such cultural heritage or if a project intends to use such cultural heritage for commercial purposes. requirements a. General The , as set out in , will consider direct, indirect and cumulative project-specific risks and impacts on cultural heritage. Through the assessment, the Borrower will determine the potential risks and impacts of the proposed activities of the project on cultural heritage. The Borrower will avoid impacts on cultural heritage. When avoidance of impacts is not possible, the Borrower will identify and implement measures to address impacts on cultural heritage in accordance with the mitigation hierarchy. Where appropriate, Mitigation measures include, for example, relocating or modifying the physical footprint of the project; conservation and rehabilitation in situ; relocation of cultural heritage; documentation; strengthening the capacity of national and subnational institutions responsible for managing cultural heritage affected by the project; establishment of a monitoring system to track the progress and efficacy of these activities; establishment of an implementation schedule and required budget for the identified mitigation measures; and cataloguing of finds. Such measures will take into account the provisions in Section Dfor specific types of cultural heritage. Borrower will develop a Cultural Heritage Man Plan. The Borrower will implement globally recognized for field-based study, documentation and of cultural heritage in connection with project, including by contractors and other third Achance finds procedure is a project-specific which will be followed if previously cultural heritage is encountered during activities. It will be included in all contracts to construction of the project, including demolition, movement of earth, floodor other changes in the physical environment. chance finds procedure will set out how chance associated with the project will be managed. procedure will include a requirement to notify authorities of found objects or sites by culheritage experts; to fence-off the area of finds sites to avoid further disturbance; to conduct an of found objects or sites by cultural experts; to identify and implement actions with the requirements of this and law; and to train project personnel and workers on chance find procedures. Where necessary due to the potential risks and of a project, the will involve the participation of cultural experts. If the determines that the project may, at any during the project life cycle, have significant risks and impacts on cultural heritage, Borrower will engage cultural heritage experts assist in the identification, valuation assessment protection of cultural heritage. Stakeholder consultation and identification of cultural heritage The Borrower will identify, in accordance with stakeholders that are relevant for the culheritage that is known to exist or is likely to encountered during the project life cycle. Stake will include, as relevant: project affected parties, including individuals and communities within the country who use or have used the cultural heritage within living memory; and other interested parties, which may include national or local regulatory authorities that are entrusted with the protection of cultural he Cultural Heritage Management Plan will include an impletimeline and an estimate of resource needs for each measure. This may be developed as a stand-alone or, depending on the nature and the scale of the risks impacts of the project, as part of the .\u201d heritage and nongovernmental organizations and cultural heritage experts, including national and international cultural heritage organizations. The Borrower will carry out meaningful consultations with stakeholders in accordance with in order to identify cultural heritage that may be affected by the potential project; consider the significance of the cultural heritage affected by the project; assess the potential risks and impacts; and explore avoidance and mitigation options. Confidentiality The Borrower, in consultation with the Bank, project-affected parties and cultural heritage experts, will determine whether disclosure of information regarding cultural heritage would compromise or jeopardize the safety or integrity of the cultural heritage or would endanger sources of information. In such cases, sensitive information may be omitted from public disclosure. If the project-affected parties hold the location, characteristics, or traditional use of the cultural heritage in secret, the Borrower will put in place measures to maintain confidentiality. Stakeholders\u2019 access Where the Borrower\u2019s project site contains cultural heritage or prevents access to previously accessible cultural heritage sites, the Borrower will, based on consultations with users of the site, allow continued access to the cultural site, or will provide an alternative access route, subject to overriding health, safety and security considerations. C. Legally protected cultural heritage areas As part of the , the Borrower will determine the presence of all listed legally protected cultural heritage areas affected by the project. If the proposed project will be located within a legally protected area or a legally defined buffer zone, the Borrower will: The Borrower will support the inclusion and cooperation of the various stakeholders through a dialogue with the appropriate authorities, including the relevant national or local regulatory authorities entrusted with the protection of cultural heritage, to establish the most effective means for addressing the views and concerns of the stakeholders and involving them in the protection and management of the cultural heritage. The significance of cultural heritage is considered according to the value systems and interests of project affected parties and other interested parties, who are concerned with the protection and appropriate use of the cultural heritage. Examples include world heritage sites and nationally and subnationally protected areas. Comply with local, national, regional or international cultural heritage regulations and the protected area management plans; Consult the protected area sponsors and managers, project-affected parties and other interested parties on the proposed project; and Implement additional programs, as appropriate, to promote and enhance the conservation aims of the protected area. Provisions for specific types of cultural heritage sites and material Archaeological sites comprise any combination structural remains, artifacts, human or ecologielements and may be located entirely beneath, above, or entirely above the land or water Archaeological material may be found anyon the earth\u2019s surface, singly or scattered large areas. Such material also includes burial human remains and fossils. Where there is evidence or high probability of human activity in the area of the project, the will conduct desk-based research and surveys to document, map and investigate remains. The Borrower will docuthe location and characteristics of archaeosites and materials discovered during the life cycle and provide such documentation the national or subnational cultural heritage The Borrower will determine, in consultation cultural heritage experts, whether archaeologimaterial discovered during the project life cycle adocumentation only excaation and or cconseration in place, and manage the archaeological material accord The Borrower will determine ownership and responsibility for archaeological material accordance with national and subnational law, until such time as custody has been tran swill arrange for identification, conservation, The applicability of regional or international cultural heritage to the project will be determined through the enviand social assessment. Most archaeological sites are hidden from view. Only rarely there no archaeological material in any given area, even if material is not known to or recognized by local people or by national or international archaeological agencies or The burial areas referred to in paragraph are those unreto current populations living in the project area. For more burial places connected directly to project-affected parappropriate mitigation measures will be identified pursuant paragraphs and through consultations with such parties. labeling, secure storage and accessibility to enable future study and analysis. Built heritage Built Heritage refers to single or groups of architectural works in their urban or rural setting as evidence of a particular civilization, a significant development or a historic event. Built Heritage includes groups of buildings, structures and open spaces constituting past or contemporary human settlements that are recognized as cohesive and valuable from an architectural, aesthetic, spiritual or sociocultural perspective. The Borrower will identify appropriate mitigation measures to address the impacts on Built Heritage, which may include documentation; conservation or rehabilitation in situ; and relocation and conservation or rehabilitation. During any rehabilitation or restoration of cultural heritage structures, the Borrower will maintain the authenticity of form, construction materials and techniques of the structure. The Borrower will preserve the physical and visual context of individual or groups of historic structures by considering the appropriateness and effect of project infrastructure proposed for location within the range of sight. Natural features with cultural significance Natural features may be imbued with cultural heritage significance. Examples include sacred hills, mountains, landscapes, streams, rivers, waterfalls, caves and rocks; sacred trees or plants, groves and forests; carvings or paintings on exposed rock faces or in caves; and paleontological deposits of early human, animal or fossilized remains. The significance of such heritage may be localized in small community groups or minority populations. The Borrower will identify, through research and consultation with project-affected parties , natural features with cultural heritage significance affected by the project, the people that value such features, and the individuals or groups with authority to represent and negotiate regarding the location, protection and use of the heritage place. In compliance with applicable national and subnational laws and or zoning regulations and in accordance with . Often the designation of cultural significance is kept secret, known only to a specific local population, and associated with ritual activities or events. The sacred character of such heritage may pose a challenge in determining how to avoid or mitigate damage. Natural cultural sites may contain archaeological material. Most natural features with cultural heritage sigare best protected by preservation in situ. it is not possible to preserve the natural features their existing location, the transfer of the cultural to another location will be conducted in with project-affected parties, in accorwith . The agreement that is reached the transfer will respect and enable conof the traditional practices associated the cultural heritage that has been transferred. cultural heritage Movable cultural heritage includes such objects historic or rare books and manuscripts; paintdrawings, sculptures, statuettes and carvings; or historic religious items; historic cosjewelry and textiles; fragments of monuor historic buildings; archaeological material; natural history collections such as shells, flora, minerals. Discoveries and access resulting from project may increase the vulnerability of cultural to theft, trafficking or abuse. The Borrower take measures to guard against theft and illetrafficking of movable cultural heritage items by the project and will notify relevant of any such activity. The Borrower, in consultation with relevant heritage authorities, will identify movable heritage objects that may be endangered the project and make provisions for their protecthroughout the project life cycle. The Borrower inform religious or secular authorities or other with responsibility for overseeing and the movable cultural heritage objects of schedule for project activities and alert them the potential vulnerability of such items. commercial use of cultural heritage Where a project intends to use cultural heriof project affected parties for commercial purposes, the will inform the project affected parties their rights under national law; the scope nature of the commercial development and potential impacts; and the potential conseof such development and impacts. The Borrower will not proceed with such comuse unless it: carries out meaning consultation with stakeholders as described in provides for fair and equitable sharing of from commercial use of such cultural hericonsistent with customs and traditions of the affected parties; and identifies mitigation according to the mitigation hierarchy. stakeholder engagement and Information introduction This recognizes the importance of open and transparent engagement between the Borrower and project stakeholders as an essential element of good international practice. Effective stakeholder engagement can improve the sustainability of projects, enhance project acceptance, and make a significant contribution to successful project design and implementation. Disclosure Stakeholder engagement is an inclusive process throughout the project life cycle. Where designed and implemented, it supports the of strong, constructive and responrelationships that are important for success management of a project\u2019s environmental and risks. Stakeholder engagement is most effecwhen initiated at an early stage of the project process, and is an integral part of early decisions and the assessment, management monitoring of the project\u2019s environmental and risks and impacts. This must be read in conjunction with . regarding engagement with workers found in . Special provisions on emergency and response are covered in and In the case of projects involving involuntary Indigenous Peoples or cultural herithe Borrower will also apply the special discloand consultation requirements set out in , and .

To assess the level of stakeholder interest and support for the project and to enable stakeholders\u2019 views to be taken into account in project design and performance. To promote and provide means for effective and inclusive engagement with project-affected parties throughout the project life cycle on issues that could potentially affect them. To ensure that appropriate project information on risks and impacts is disclosed to stakeholders in a timely, understandable, accessible and appropriate manner and format. To provide project-affected parties with accessible and inclusive means to raise issues and grievances, and allow Borrowers to respond to and manage such grievances. Scope of application applies to all projects supported by the Bank through Investment Project Financing. The Borrower will engage with stakeholders as an integral part of the project\u2019s assessment and project design and implementation, as outlined in . For the purpose of this , \u201cstakeholder\u201d refers to individuals or groups who: are affected or likely to be affected by the project ; and may have an interest in the project . requirements Borrowers will engage with stakeholders throughout the project life cycle, commencing such engagement as early as possible in the project development process and in a time frame that enables meaningful consultations with stakeholders on project design. The nature, scope and frequency of stakeholder engagement will be proportionate to the nature and scale of the project and its potential risks and impacts. Borrowers will engage in meaningful consultations with all stakeholders. Borrowers will provide stakeholders with timely, relevant, understandable and accessible information, and consult with them in a culturally appropriate manner, which is free of manipulation, interference, coercion, discrimination and intimidation. The process of stakeholder engagement will involve the following, as set out in further detail in this : istakeholder identification and analysis planning how the engagement with stakeholders will take place; disclosure of information; i consultation with stakeholders addressing and responding to grieances and ireporting to stakeholders. The Borrower will maintain, and disclose as part of the , a documented record of stakeholder engagement, including a description of the stakeholders consulted, a summary of the feedback received and a brief explanation of how the feedback was taken into account, or the reasons why it was not. Engagement during project preparation identification and analysis The Borrower will identify the different stake both project-affected parties and other parties. As set out in paragraph 5, indior groups that are affected or likely to be by the project will be identified as \u2018projectparties\u2019 and other individuals or groups may have an interest in the project will be idenas \u2018other interested parties\u2019.
